Interview with the Vampire,Anne Rice,"This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Supernatural', 'Historical Fiction', 'Urban Fantasy']",4.02,"576,775 ratings","15,532 reviews","219,916","198,807","116,405","30,826","10,821"

Persuasion,Jane Austen,"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Audiobook', '19th Century', 'Historical Romance', 'Classic Literature']",4.15,"682,624 ratings","31,428 reviews","302,602","227,353","115,833","25,462","11,374"

At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.

In a world of hierarchies, he is at the top when she arrives as little more than flotsam cast up on Athenian shores. Their love transcends social sanctions, enduring and deepening despite the grave threat it presents to Pericles' reputation as a leader of the Athenian democracy.The novel unfolds against the background of the arts and history of the Golden Age, seen through the eyes of two individuals who lent their particular brilliance to make it ""golden"": Pericles, the great orator and visionary of democracy, and its most influential woman, Aspasia.

The Grapes of Wrath,John Steinbeck,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School', 'American', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'High School']",4.00,"889,336 ratings","23,244 reviews","373,445","271,679","152,353","57,763","34,096"

East of Eden,John Steinbeck,"In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', '20th Century']",4.41,"525,517 ratings","28,014 reviews","310,624","142,447","53,625","12,987",
Dragon Seed,Pearl S. Buck,"One of the more political novels from the pen of Pearl Buck, Dragon Seed brings to light the tragedy of the Japanese invasion and occupation of mainland China during WWII. Centering her story around the fictional family of Ling Tan, Buck recreates the heart wrenching devastation that war inflicted on these gentle innocent people. Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. ""Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'China', 'Classics', 'Asia', 'War', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Novels']",4.09,"3,267 ratings",261 reviews,"1,198","1,305",632,108,24
Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson,"""For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, Treasure Island has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil.

Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like that can keep boys and old men happy.'","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Childrens', 'Pirates', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Novels']",3.84,"479,427 ratings","15,947 reviews","136,662","176,989","128,559","28,681","8,536"

Hild,Nicola Griffith,"Hild is born into a world in transition. In seventh-century Britain, small kingdoms are merging, usually violently. A new religion is coming ashore; the old gods’ priests are worrying. Edwin of Northumbria plots to become overking of the Angles, ruthlessly using every tool at his disposal: blood, bribery, belief.Hild is the king’s youngest niece. She has the powerful curiosity of a bright child, a will of adamant, and a way of seeing the world—of studying nature, of matching cause with effect, of observing human nature and predicting what will happen next—that can seem uncanny, even supernatural, to those around her. She establishes herself as the king’s seer. And she is indispensable—until she should ever lead the king astray. The stakes are life and death: for Hild, her family, her loved ones, and the increasing numbers who seek the protection of the strange girl who can read the world and see the future.Hild is a young woman at the heart of the violence, subtlety, and mysticism of the early medieval age—all of it brilliantly and accurately evoked by Nicola Griffith’s luminous prose.

After that, the stone structure was built, and that still stands today.

The Bell Jar,Sylvia Plath,"The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.","['Fiction', 'Feminism', 'Classics', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology', 'Literature', 'Mental Illness', 'Poetry', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult']",4.05,"906,970 ratings","50,870 reviews","341,480","338,581","170,402","42,426","14,081"
The Iliad,Homer,"Dating to the ninth century B.C., Homer’s timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to the wrenching, tragic conclusion of the Trojan War. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace.Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”","['Classics', 'Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Greek Mythology', 'War']",3.90,"441,005 ratings","11,392 reviews","152,554","145,238","102,242","29,735","11,236"

The Master and Margarita,Mikhail Bulgakov,"The first complete, annotated English Translation of Mikhail Bulgakov's comic masterpiece.An audacious revision of the stories of Faust and Pontius Pilate, The Master and Margarita is recognized as one of the essential classics of modern Russian literature. The novel's vision of Soviet life in the 1930s is so ferociously accurate that it could not be published during its author's lifetime and appeared only in a censored edition in the 1960s. Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him. What ensues is a novel of inexhaustible energy, humor, and philosophical depth, a work whose nuances emerge for the first time in Diana Burgin's and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor's splendid English version.","['Fiction', 'Russia', 'Fantasy', 'Russian Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction']",4.29,"340,939 ratings","19,638 reviews","184,247","95,164","43,194","13,046","5,288"

The Pillars of the Earth,Ken Follett,"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape.Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Medieval', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'British Literature', 'Adult']",4.34,"750,933 ratings","36,814 reviews","417,683","216,883","79,944","23,250","13,173"

Murder At The Fort: A Double Homicide Cold Case And Cover Up!,Bob Marmion,"Early one cold, wintry morning in late May 1942, the bullet-ridden body of Driver Roy Willis was found on the side of the road. He had been shot a number of times with a military revolver. Despite extensive enquiries by some of the Victoria Police’s most experienced homicide detectives, the murderer was not found. Then three months later, the killer struck again. In September 1942 Gunner John Hulston went missing whilst on guard duty. His gun crew immediately began a search. Two soldiers followed what appeared to be drag marks from the gate down towards the beach. They saw a figure some way off and thinking it was Hulston, they called out to him. Instead of a friendly reply, they were met with a barrage of bullets. The figure ran off and disappeared towards the camp. Incredibly the garrison was not turned out to search for the missing man or the mysterious figure. The searchlights which could have turned the night into day along the beach, were not activated. Hulston’s rifle and bayonet were found in the water. His torn trousers were also found on the beach. His body was eventually recovered further along the coastline, 10 days later. Like Driver Willis, back in May, he had also been shot in the chest with a .455 calibre army revolver. As with any good murder mystery, this story has more twists and turns than the Great Ocean Road. They range from black market operations, confessions, suspects identified in later years, lost or missing police files, disagreements between the police and the army over the investigation, and an attempted cover-up that went all the way to the wartime Deputy Prime Minister’s office.",[],4.36,362 ratings,0 reviews,170,166,16,5,5

Notes from Underground & The Grand Inquisitor,Fyodor Dostoevsky,"Dostoevsky's influence on the modern literary mind is unrivalled in its scope and vitality. Nowhere does his art appear in so quintessential a form as in Notes from Underground, certainly one of the most revolutionary and original works in world literature; nowhere is his thought presented with such authority as in ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" an episode of central importance taken from his last and greatest novel, The Brothers Karamazov. In both these vital works Dostoevsky confronts the reader with the tragic grandeur of man, indeed, with a whole philosophy of tragedy: the tragedy of the individual and freedom, the tragedy of the historical process, the tragedy of universal evil.Relevant works included by Chernyshevsky, Schedrin and Dostoevsky.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Russia', 'Philosophy', 'Russian Literature', 'Politics', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Religion']",4.20,911 ratings,70 reviews,410,324,134,35,8

The Crucible: A Play in Four Acts,Arthur Miller,"""I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,"" Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, ""Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.""WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Read For School', 'Historical', 'High School', 'Literature', 'Theatre']",3.60,"400,356 ratings","11,669 reviews","87,372","134,357","122,338","42,696","13,593"

"Goodnight, and Thanks for the Vodka [2002]",Harpie,"A book of Raw Emotion!In Harpie’s wacky, psycho, screwball, demented book she bares her soul, revealing her innermost thoughts, slashing a metaphoric vein and bleeding onto the pageHarpie’s deepest and most intimate feelings gush from her, revealing anxieties ranging from her feelings for her mother, who died in tragic and suspicious circumstances, to her resentment towards her father. And then there were others who abused her physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually. All this is tied up and interwoven with her love of her young son, Mike.Harpie has memories buried deep in shadowy parts of her subconscious that she’s never been able to reach. They include the mystery surrounding her mother’s murder. With the help of a clinical psychologist and regressive hypnotism, she revisits the past as she dips in and out of Now and Then.In 'Vodka' Harpie uncovers the missing parts her lost childhood.More than a modern-day and quirky diary, this is the story of one woman’s life in a typical English small town, encompassing the characters, texture and mentality of everyday living, told with brutal and shameless honesty while all the while cross-threading with a struggle for survival and acceptance.This is no jump on the bandwagon 'pity me' story, as the vein of humour running through every chapter is testament. Harpie’s goal in writing ‘Vodka’ is to prove to the cynics that it can be done. She can write her truth and miss nothing out – heart attacks, miscarriages, beatings, blood gushing, sex, poverty, mayhem, men and vodka - and always with that beautiful self-deprecating sense of humour common to the British.After suffering a miscarriage, followed by a heart attack and having stopped breathing in intensive care she signs herself out of the hospital, clothing caked in dried blood, because there’s nobody at home to see to the animals. The following day Harpie berates herself for just sitting about moping all day on the sofa, so scrubs herself up and goes down the pub. The next day she walks four miles to the hospital to pick her car up, reasoning that “the walk might do me some good.” You can’t help but admire and applaud her efforts to keep her life on track, staying in work and as a single mum ensuring her child has a safe home life.This book began as a social experiment in honesty after a debate among authors about how honest it's possible to be. Harpie set out to prove that everything can be written, the good, the bad and the shameful. There is nowhere that this woman won’t go. If there’s a line to cross, Harpie will stick out her chest and limbo under it, jump over it or dance through it with a glass of vodka in her hand while never spilling a drop.This is a book of raw emotion …. And it bleedsKW",[],4.12,381 ratings,6 reviews,176,113,64,18,10

Well, perhaps not ""soul"" . . . He hastily sold his years ago in order to learn the laws of necromancy. But now, tormented by a dark secret, he travels to the fiery pits of Hell to retrieve it. Satan, who is incredibly bored these days, proposes a little wager: Johannes has one year to persuade one hundred people to sign over their souls or he will be damned forever.To make the bet even more interesting, Satan throws in that diabolical engine of deceit, seduction, and corruption known as a ""traveling circus"" to aid in the evil bidding. What better place exists to rob poor sad saps of their souls than the traveling carnivals historically run by hucksters and legendary con men?With little time to lose, Johannes raises a motley crew from the dead and enlists his brother, Horst, a charismatic vampire (an unfortunate side effect of Johannes's early experiments with necromancy), to be the carnival's barker. On the road through the pastoral English countryside, this team of reprobates wields their black magic with masterful ease, resulting in mayhem at every turn.Johannes may have the moral conscience of anthrax, but are his tricks sinful enough to beat the Devil at his own game? You'll never guess, and that's a promise!Brilliantly written and wickedly funny, ""Johannes Cabal the Necromancer"" combines the chills and thrills of old-fashioned gothic tales like ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" the mischievous humor of ""Wicked,"" and the sophisticated charms of"" Jonathan Strange &Mr. Norrell ""and spins the Faustian legend into a fresh, irreverent, and irresistible new adventure.","['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Steampunk', 'Humor', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Supernatural', 'Audiobook']",3.92,"20,311 ratings","2,084 reviews","6,268","8,139","4,388","1,135",381

Oedipus at Colonus,Sophocles,"The latest title to join the acclaimed Greek Tragedy in New Translations series, Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus tells the story of the last day in the life of Oedipus. It was written at the end of the fifth century BCE in Athens, in the final years of the ""Golden Age"" of Athenian culture, and in the last year of Sophocles' own life. At the center of the play is the mysterious transformation of Oedipus from an old and blind beggar, totally dependent on his daughters, to the man who rises from his seat and, without help, leads everyone to the place where he is destined to die. In the background of this transformation stands the grove of the Furies, the sacred place of the implacable goddesses who pursue the violators of blood relationships. Although Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother, is an obvious target of the Furies' vengeance, he enters their grove at the beginning of the play, sure that it is the resting place Apollo has predicted for him. The reversals and paradoxes in the play speak to the struggle that Oedipus' life and the action of the play bring vividly before us: how do we as humans, subject to constant change, find stable ground on which to stand and define our moral lives? Sophocles offers his play as a witness to the remarkable human capacity to persevere in this struggle.","['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Theatre', 'Tragedy', 'Ancient', 'Literature', 'Poetry']",3.75,"14,405 ratings",522 reviews,"3,982","4,723","4,195","1,193",312

The Butlerian Jihad,Brian Herbert,"Legends of Dune:The Butlerian Jihad It began in the Time of Tyrants, when ambitious men and women used high-powered computers to seize control of the heart of the Old Empire including Earth itself. The tyrants translated their brains into mobile mechanical bodies and created a new race, the immortal man-machine hybrids called cymeks. Then the cymeks' world-controlling planetary computers, each known as Omnius, seized control from their overlords and a thousand years of brutal rule by the thinking machines began.The human race still clings to life. Some, like idealistic Serena Butler of the free planet Salusa Secundus and her betrothed, the soldier Xavier Harkonnen, even dream of overthrowing the machines and freeing their human slaves. Others, like Vorian Atreides, bastard son of the cymek Agamemnon, are proud to serve the machines. But their world faces disaster. Impatient with human beings' endless disobedience and the cymeks' continual plotting to regain their power, Omnius has decided that it no longer needs them. Only victory can save the human race from extermination.Decades after Herbert’s original novels, the Dune saga was continued by Frank Herbert’s son, Brian Herbert, in collaboration with Kevin J.

When we first meet her—on Long Island, in the summer of 1958—Ruth is only four.The second window into Ruth’s life opens on the fall of 1990, when she is an unmarried woman whose personal life is not nearly as successful as her literary career.

She’s about to fall in love for the first time.Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing, A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force.

Henry VIII,William Shakespeare,"Henry VIII is a history play generally believed to be a collaboration between William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, based on the life of Henry VIII of England. An alternative title, All is True, is recorded in contemporary documents, the title Henry VIII not appearing until the play's publication in the First Folio of 1623. Stylistic evidence indicates that individual scenes were written by either Shakespeare or his collaborator and successor, John Fletcher. It is also somewhat characteristic of the late romances in its structure. It is noted for having more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays.[1]During a performance of Henry VIII at the Globe Theatre in 1613, a cannon shot employed for special effects ignited the theatre's thatched roof (and the beams), burning the original building to the ground.","['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Poetry', 'Theatre', 'Historical', '17th Century']",3.51,"9,122 ratings",480 reviews,"1,958","2,593","3,038","1,179",354

Every summer, his compliant wife agrees to a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be different.Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and beyond, Ha Jin vividly conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the demands of human longing must contend with the weight of centuries of custom. Waiting charms and startles us with its depiction of a China that remains hidden to Western eyes even as it moves us with its piercing vision of the universal complications of love.","['Fiction', 'China', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asian Literature', 'Historical', 'Romance']",3.54,"22,065 ratings","2,109 reviews","3,639","8,107","7,348","2,378",593

Nicholas Nickleby,Charles Dickens,"When Nicholas Nickleby is left penniless after his father's death, he appeals to his wealthy uncle to help him find work and to protect his mother and sister. But Ralph Nickleby proves both hard-hearted and unscrupulous, and Nicholas finds himself forced to make his own way in the world.

Mrs. Kennedy and Me: An Intimate Memoir,Clint Hill,"The #1 New York Times bestselling memoir by Clint Hill that Kirkus Reviews called “clear and honest prose free from salaciousness and gossip,” Jackie Kennedy’s personal Secret Service agent details his very close relationship with the First Lady during the four years leading up to and following President John F. Kennedy’s tragic assassination.In those four years, Hill was by Mrs. Kennedy’s side for some of the happiest moments as well as the darkest. He was there for the birth of John, Jr. on November 25, 1960, as well as for the birth and sudden death of Patrick Bouvier Kennedy on August 8, 1963. Three and a half months later, the unthinkable happened.Forty-seven years after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the one vivid image that never leaves Clint Hill’s mind is that of President Kennedy’s head lying on Mrs. Kennedy’s lap in the back seat of the limousine, his eyes fixed, blood splattered all over the back of the car, Mrs. Kennedy, and Hill as well. Sprawled on the trunk of the car as it sped away from Dealey Plaza, Hill clung to the sides of the car, his feet wedged in so his body was as high as possible.Clint Hill jumped on the car too late to save the president, but all he knew after that first shot was that if more shots were coming, the bullets had to hit him instead of the First Lady.Mrs. Kennedy’s strength, class, and dignity over those tragic four days in November 1963 held the country together.This is the story, told for the first time, of the man who perhaps held her together.","['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Politics', 'Autobiography', 'American History', 'Presidents']",4.24,"16,639 ratings","1,858 reviews","7,647","5,957","2,455",460,120

Li-lin, the daughter of a renowned Daoshi exorcist, is a young widow burdened with yin eyes—the unique ability to see the spirit world. Her spiritual visions and the death of her husband bring shame to Li-lin and her father—and shame is not something this immigrant family can afford.When a sorcerer cripples her father, terrible plans are set in motion, and only Li-lin can stop them.

The Sellout,Paul Beatty,"A biting satire about a young man's isolated upbringing and the race trial that sends him to the Supreme Court, Paul Beatty's The Sellout showcases a comic genius at the top of his game. It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality―the black Chinese restaurant.Born in the ""agrarian ghetto"" of Dickens―on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles―the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: ""I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake."" Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident―the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins―he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.","['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Race', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'African American', 'Literature', 'American', 'Audiobook']",3.75,"67,895 ratings","7,304 reviews","18,191","25,313","16,301","5,604","2,486"

A Small Death in Lisbon,Robert Wilson,"Winner of the prestigious Gold Dagger Award in the U.K. for the best mystery of 1999, this complex literary thriller may be one of the most satisfying suspense novels to come along in some time. Robert Wilson has written several political thrillers, most of which are set in West Africa, but they are, alas, largely unavailable in the U.S.In A Small Death in Lisbon, the narrative switches back and forth between 1941 and 1999, and Wilson's wide knowledge of history and keen sense of place make the eras equally vibrant. In 1941 Germany, Klaus Felsen, an industrialist, is approached by the SS high command in a none-too-friendly manner and is ""persuaded"" to go to Lisbon and oversee the sale--or smuggling--of wolfram (also known as tungsten, used in the manufacture of tanks and airplanes). World War II Portugal is neutral where business is concerned, and too much of the precious metal is being sold to Britain when Germany needs it to insure that Hitler's blitzkrieg is successful.Cut to 1999 Lisbon, where the daughter of a prominent lawyer has been found dead on a beach. Ze Coelho, a liberal police inspector who is a widower with a daughter of his own, must sift through the life of Catarina Oliveira and discover why she was so brutally murdered. Her father is enigmatic, her mother suicidal; her friends were rock musicians and drug addicts.The reader is treated to a wonderful portrait of Lisbon in the aftermath of the 1974 revolution that ousted Salazar from power, and the scars from that conflict are still close to the surface for the citizens of Lisbon, including Coehlo and his colleagues.

And for the first time, Peabody is primary detective on the case, which means she has to get used to a new level of authority and responsibility. Good thing she learned the ropes from a master like Eve.But after rounding up the perps, Peabody stumbles upon a much trickier situation. Determined to start working out as hard as she grills suspects, she chooses to do it at the old, rarely-used gym at Central. After a grueling workout, she squeezes into one of the narrow shower stalls, happy to have the place to herself. Just after she shuts the water off, the gym door clatters open — and while she cringes inside the stall, trying not to make a sound, Peabody overhears two fellow officers, Garnet and Oberman, arguing. References are made to delivering product, and a house in the islands, and someone named Keener who’s supposed to look like an OD. It doesn’t take long for a naked and vulnerable Peabody to realize that both officers are crooked — guilty not just of corruption but of murder as well. Fortunately, the two clear out of the locker room without realizing there was a witness.Eve Dallas may have trained Peabody well — but this is too dangerous for one person to take on alone. Now Peabody, Eve, and her husband, Roarke, must try to get the hard evidence they need to bring the dirty cops down — knowing all the while that the two have already killed to keep their secret, and are no doubt willing to do it again.11 Audio CDs / 13 Hours 14 mins~","['Mystery', 'Romance', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Futuristic', 'Suspense', 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction', 'Audiobook']",4.46,"30,347 ratings","1,558 reviews","17,814","9,349","2,715",322,147

The Quincunx,Charles Palliser,"The protagonist, a young man naive enough to be blind to all clues about his own hidden history (and to the fact that his very existence is troubling to all manner of evildoers) narrates a story of uncommon beauty which not only brings readers face-to-face with dozens of piquantly drawn characters at all levels of 19th-century English society but re-creates with precision the tempestuous weather and gnarly landscape that has been a motif of the English novel since Wuthering Heights. The suspension of disbelief happens easily, as the reader is led through twisted family trees and plot lines.The quincunx of the title is a heraldic figure of five parts that appears at crucial points within the text (the number five recurs throughout the novel, which itself is divided into five parts, one for each of the family galaxies whose orbits the narrator is pulled into). Quintuple the length of the ordinary novel, this extraordinary tour de force also has five times the ordinary allotment of adventure, action and aplomb.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Victorian', 'British Literature', 'Gothic', 'Novels', 'Mystery Thriller', '19th Century']",4.01,"7,975 ratings",629 reviews,"3,340","2,551","1,243",505,336

The Prince,Niccolò Machiavelli,"Machiavelli needs to be looked at as he really was. Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term? 1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people. 2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose. 4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure. 9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice 10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force. The first is rightly man’s way; the second, the way of beasts.","['Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Literature', 'Political Science', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'School']",3.84,"329,179 ratings","12,288 reviews","98,433","115,594","85,182","22,675","7,295"

River of Darkness,Rennie Airth,"In a quiet and picturesque English countryside where people are still recuperating from the ravages of World War I, the peace of a small Surrey village is shattered by the discovery of a horrifying murder. Five victims; four of them killed with military efficiency and, judging from the wounds, a military bayonet. The fifth victim, the lady of the house, is found nearly naked, sprawled on a bed, her throat slashed with a razor. Even more startling than the actual carnage are two subsequent findings: the lack of any sort of sexual assault and the discovery of a child - a young girl hiding beneath a bed.Scotland Yard sends out Inspector John Madden to investigate the murders. Madden, with some heavy psychological baggage of his own courtesy of the war, recognizes the mark of madness in the killer's work and has a unique understanding of the killer's methods, habits, and rituals. While the local constabulary figures the murders for a robbery gone horribly wrong, Madden is quick to recognize the presence of a more sinister motive. He seeks the help of Dr. Helen Blackwell, a local physician who lost both her brothers and her husband to the war. Dr. Blackwell's professional connections include a Viennese psychiatrist who is well versed in the relatively new field of forensic psychology, and together they try to develop a psychological profile for the killer.The deeper Madden digs into the case, the harder it is for him to maintain the fragile wall he has built around his own painful memories. A spark between him and Helen Blackwell quickly becomes an all-consuming fire, and in the tender exploratory phase of their relationship, Helen gently urges him to face his personal demons head-on.Meanwhile, Madden discovers the killer has struck once before, a murder that was left unsolved. When Madden gets the idea to look for similar crimes that may have occurred during the war, he finds one, and a clearer and even more frightening picture of the killer begins to evolve. As the police investigation proceeds, plodding at times and getting fortuitous breaks at others, the killer plans his next attack. Together, killer and cops move along parallel timelines, a loose scrabble of concurrent events held together by a taut string of tension. When the string finally breaks, it culminates in a vivid and terrifying climax that demonstrates how fine a line often exists between sanity and utter madness.is the first book in a promised series. Inspector John Madden is precisely the type of multifaceted and complex character readers will enjoy meeting time and again. And the supporting cast of characters is the perfect complement, the sum total being a rich and full-bodied story. What's more, if Airth shows the same flair for finely etched prose and brilliantly manipulated tension as he does here, this series promises to be the start of a powerful new niche in psychological suspense, a uniquely fresh voice that will stand out among the crowd.","['Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical Mystery', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Mystery Thriller', 'British Literature', 'Thriller', 'Suspense']",3.95,"8,531 ratings",737 reviews,"2,760","3,466","1,652",439,214

Tandy Willowby, one of the moms-to-be in Mavis's birthing class, didn't show up for the shower.

J is for Judgment,Sue Grafton,"""J"" is for Jaffe: Wendell Jaffe, dead these past five years. Or so it seemed until his former insurance agent spotted him in the bar of a dusty little Mexican resort halfway between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.What did Kinsey Millhone have to say? ""In truth, the facts about Wendell Jaffe had nothing to do with my family history, but murder is seldom tidy and no one ever said revelations operate in a straight line. It was my investigation into the dead man's past that triggered the inquiry into my own, and in the end the two stories became difficult to separate.""Five years ago, when Jaffe's thirty-five-foot ketch was found drifting off the Baja coast, it seemed a sure thing he'd gone overboard. The note he left behind admitted he was flat broke, his business bankrupt, and his real estate gambit nothing but a huge Ponzi scheme about to collapse with criminal indictment certain to follow. When the authorities descended on his bank and his books soon after, there was nothing left; Jaffe had stripped the lot.But Jaffe wasn't quite without assets. There was his $500,000 life insurance policy made out to his wife and underwritten by California Fidelity. With no corpse to prove death, however, the insurance company was in no hurry to pay the claim. Dana Jaffe had to wait out the statutory five years until her missing husband could be declared legally dead. Just two months before Wendell Jaffe was sighted in that Mexican bar, California Fidelity finally paid in full. Now they wanted the truth. And they were willing to hire Kinsey Millhone to dig it up.J is for judgment - the kind we're quick to make and often quicker to regret. It's about family, Wendell's and Kinsey's.""J Is for Judgment"" is Kinsey Millhone's tenth excursion into the dark places of the heart where duplicity is the governing rule and murder the too-frequent result.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Murder Mystery', 'Adult']",4.03,"53,987 ratings",965 reviews,"18,058","21,230","13,091","1,288",320

Exit Unicorns,Cindy Brandner,"In this sweeping and powerful epic the journey begins in the 'terrible beauty' of Northern Ireland during a time when conflict reigns and no one is spared from tragedy and sorrow, the time known as The Troubles. It is the spring of 1968 in Belfast and James Kirkpatrick has just lost his father under suspicious circumstances, Casey Riordan is released from prison after five years and Pamela O'Flaherty has crossed an ocean and a lifetime of memories to find the man she fell in love with as a little girl. All three lives are on a collision course with each other against the backdrop of the burgeoning civil rights movement and a nation on the brink of revolution. They come from disparate backgrounds-Jamie a wealthy aristocrat whose life is like an imperfect but multi-faceted jewel-brilliant, flawed and with a glitter that is designed to distract the observer. Casey, a card-carrying member of the Irish Republican Army, who must face the fact that five years away has left him a stranger, a misfit in his own neighborhood where not everyone is sympathetic to a convicted rebel. Pamela, who has come to Ireland in search of a memory and a man who may not have existed in the first place. Through it all runs the ribbon of a love story: love of country, the beginning love of two people unable to resist the pull of each other regardless of the cost to themselves and those around them, and the selfless love of one man who no longer believes himself capable of such emotion. It is an electrifying tale of a people divided by religion and politics, a tale of love and danger, of triumph and tragedy. Ultimately it is the story of that 'terrible beauty' herself-Ireland-and how nation is bound to one's identity, woven into the weft of all we become.","['Historical Fiction', 'Ireland', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Irish Literature', 'Historical Romance', 'Adult Fiction']",3.98,"1,381 ratings",173 reviews,592,394,243,85,67

Sneaker World,B.R. Snow,"Sir Bentley Carruthers, sneaker magnate and exploiter of the poor on four continents, has decided to expand his empire into the lucrative field of biopiracy. He’s purchased a small group of islands from the Indian government, ostensibly to assist with recovery efforts after a devastating tsunami. So he’s built a sneaker factory on one of the islands along with a high-end resort that caters exclusively to the uber-rich. Unfortunately for Sir Bentley, Doc and the rest of the Damaged Posse are aware of what his real motives are. And the fact that Sir Bentley has been selling off weapons technology to the highest bidders also hasn’t gone unnoticed. After the Posse arrives on the island, they embark on their strangest and funniest adventure yet that is filled with dense jungles, a lost tribe, cantankerous girlfriends, shoulder-fired missiles, and a safari suit wearing antagonist you’ll love to hate.“When I initially sat down to read Sneaker World, I expected to find all the usual hallmarks I’ve come to expect from B.R. Snow’s Damaged Posse series; great characters, smart dialogue, and lots and lots of laughs. I have to say I wasn’t disappointed and Sneaker World consistently delivers on all fronts. However, as I kept reading, I found something else occurring that surprised me. The book contains some very important messages about what is going on in the world around us. Dig down just below the surface and you’ll discover some serious issues being discussed and I would caution readers not to think that Sneaker World, while hysterical, is just a very funny book. They say making someone laugh is one of the hardest things to do; being able to make people laugh and think at the same time is a gift. And I have to say, Sneaker World is a gift, and B.R. Snow is one gifted writer.”""The soft underbelly of globalization is exposed and fully taken to task. Like the previous books in the Damaged Posse series, Sneaker World opens up on several fronts, folds back on itself and seamlessly combines a strange collection of characters into one hysterical narrative.

Pnin,Vladimir Nabokov,"One of the best-loved of Nabokov’s novels, Pnin features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian émigré precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950's. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader’s deepest protective instinct.Serialized in and published in book form in 1957, brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Humor']",3.89,"24,190 ratings","2,110 reviews","6,726","9,961","5,861","1,346",296

The Ice Limit - La barrière de glace,Douglas Preston,"(English below)Sur une île déserte au nord du Cap Horn est découverte la plus grosse météorite jamais tombée sur terre. Le riche entrepreneur américain Palmer Lloyd décide de se l'approprier et de la joindre à la collection du musée qu'il fait construire à New York. Mais jamais encore un objet aussi gros n'a été transporté par voie maritime. Pour y parvenir, il est prêt à sacrifier argent et vie humaine. Il fait appel à deux hommes, Mc Farlam, scientifique et chasseur de météorites, et Eli Glim, homme de terrain autoritaire et résolu.Mais l'acheminement de cet objet interstellaire se révèle difficile. Il apparaît peu à peu qu'il possède des pouvoirs étranges et inquiétants. De nombreux membres de l'expédition succombent. Réussissant néanmoins à le charger sur le tanker, l'équipe de Lloyd est prise en chasse par un destroyer dirigé par un commandant chilien, qui souhaite récupérer la météorite pour le compte de son pays. Une course-poursuite s'engage alors à travers les glaces de l'Antarctique.Reviews:From School Library JournalYA-Hired to locate a meteorite and transfer it to a billionaire collector's new museum, Sam McFarlane uses high technology and groups of experts to find, dig up, and begin shipping the gigantic rock. However, Commandante Vallenar of the Chilean Navy doesn't want it removed from his country. Action on the tanker reaches an intense strain as the crew and members of the recovery team struggle with both the meteorite and a killer storm, a panteonero, which threatens to overwhelm the ship. Gunfire from Vallenar's ship initiates a life-and-death chase as both vessels sail into the frigid waters off Tierra del Fuego. The meteorite, full of unknown properties and prone to sudden bursts of electrical charges, offers the biggest surprise of all, as the ocean stands ready to claim everyone and everything. This is a tempestuous adventure of high seas, high stakes, and high excitement. As characters enter the story, their personalities expand along with the intricate plot, taking on more intensity and power. The extreme hostility of the environment eventually proves to be the deciding factor. Like Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm (Norton, 1997), this natural thriller is not to be missed.Pam Johnson, Fairfax County Public Library, VACopyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.From Library JournalThe scene: a ship near Cape Horn off the Chilean coast. The cast: a well-paid but dedicated and courageous staff of technicians, including a female skipper and a scientist""each with a questionable past. The problem in this adventure by best-selling coauthors Preston and Child (Riptide): how to transport the biggest meteorite ever to a New York museum without attracting the attention of the Chilean authorities and the press? Add the further complication that the meteorite derives from a strange, unfamiliar element. At one point, the vessel is attacked and trapped by a Chilean ship. As the suspense builds, the various strands of the plot come together. Will the ship survive? What happens to the meteorite""if, indeed, it is a meteorite? The book is recommended with one reservation: if you don!t enjoy necessary technical passages, you may be bored. On the other hand, if you enjoy Clive Cussler, you!ll probably enjoy this novel.-""Fred M. Gervat, Concordia Coll. Lib., Bronxville, NYCopyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.From BooklistFrom this popular team comes another solid thriller. Billionaire Palmer Lloyd's hobby is buying up rare artifacts; the current object of his desire is the world's largest meteorite, buried on an island off the coast of Chile. Eli Glinn is the head of the high-tech engineering firm Palmer hires to figure out a way to bring the meteorite home to the U.S. Sam McFarlane is the down-and-out meteorite hunter, the expert whose own theory about the origins of the meteorite, if proven to be true, could spell disaster for everyone involved. It is no accident that this fits the description of a big-budget feature film. After all, Preston and Child have a history of writing novels that read like movies in prose form, with exciting stories, plenty of interesting characters (here we also have a boat captain who's a recovering alcoholic), and visually arresting set pieces. Most of the novel's action takes place either on Rolvaag, a huge tanker rebuilt to carry the enormous meteorite, or on Isla Desolacion, where Palmer's group tries to uncover, and move, the meteorite without losing too many lives in the process; both locations are perfect for the big screen. The characterizations here are rather deeper than those found in most of the team's previous thrillers--the players are more like people and less like stick figures--but, as always, the action is what keeps readers turning the pages. The authors' fans will appreciate their new novel, as will fans of such writers as Michael Crichton and Clive Cussler. David PittCopyright © American Library Association.

SSN Seadragon: The Crucible of Leviathan,J.P. Ronald,"A “Leviathan spirit” is said to be a demon spirit controlled by Satan. When unleashed, it leaves total destruction in its wake, and cannot be subdued by normal human methods, but only by the power of God. The Cold War saw “Leviathan” snarling at his gate, salivating to be let loose, when humanity was treading ever closer to nuclear holocaust. During this period, American servicemen went into the breech to stand against whatever form “Leviathan” took, and like the American warriors of past years they held strong to their faith in God to see them through.Such a warrior is Daniel O’Kean, a World War II UDT/OSS veteran and commissioned naval officer, turned covert deep-penetration maritime CIA specialist, who has only his faith to see him through his own encounters with “Leviathan.” His first test is a pre-invasion, reconnaissance mission behind the lines of Inchon Korea, where the threat of capture by North Korean invaders is around every corner. Later he leads an assignment into Latvia with near disastrous consequences. Then called upon again, into the steaming jungles near Haiphong Vietnam, while attempting to retrieve evidence of active Soviet intervention in the war, he uncovers an unusual and vital turn of events that leads to a twisted plot in the streets of London England.With each step he takes he sees God’s hand guiding himcloser to a fate he does not fully understand, but follows faithfully.While O’Kean is battling an evil he cannot see, the captain of the nuclear submarine USS Seadragon, LCDR Renzo MacKenna has his own faith challenged in another form of “Leviathan” as he and CDR David Heidleman of the USS Permit coordinate to foil a Soviet plot to end America’s involvement in Vietnam. One wrong move by them and “Leviathan’s” bite could go nuclear.",[],4.02,46 ratings,7 reviews,19,20,0,3,4

Gatsby's Smile,Morana Blue,"Gatsby's Smile is a psychological thriller/murder mystery.A police psychiatrist's Imaginary Friend from childhood reappears and, in order to save future victims' lives, persuades the grieving doc to murder all the suspects in a mysterious serial killer case.Dr Morana 'Moody' Blue, fears she's begun to manifest the symptoms of schizophrenia because Maro, the Imaginary Friend she had as a child, has reappeared – all grown up. Morana is aware that Maro's appearance is a subconscious manifestation of her recent grief as she's just suffered a miscarriage; but intellectually understanding your grief doesn't make dealing with it any emotionally easier. She knows, too, that schizophrenia tends to run in families – and her mother is positively psychotic.Estranged from her unrequited love, the father of her lost baby, Police Chief Harry Black, Morana is nevertheless drawn into Harry's investigation of the murders of two young women discovered wide-eyed, naked, their pubic hair shaved – but without a single murderous mark upon their perfect bodies. Suspiciously, though, when Morana witnesses the grisly murder of a third girl, she chases the murderer into the woods only to be found, the next morning, covered in the dead girl's blood and clutching the weapon that killed her.Morana believes then that the murderer is trying to frame her and so must be someone she knows. Someone close. Her deductions garner four suspects: misogynistic Harry himself; Harry's mysterious new coke-addled sidekick DS Young; Robert the secretive Police Coroner with a penchant for nyotaimori geishas; and Doc the local GP/Police doctor who, she discovers, hasn't as gentle a bedside manner as he ought to have.The four suspects themselves, however, gather evidence enough to believe that Morana herself is responsible for the serial murders: her clutching the murder weapon aside, no witnesses come forward to corroborate her story about the killer hightailing it from the murder scene – and she seems to be losing her mind: she's unpredictable these days; she's abusive, violent even, and she's talking to herself a lot… out loud.In the face of Harry's rising fury, DS Young's amusement, Robert's conspicuous pity and Doc's simmering resentment, though, Morana does what she does best: by analysing the corpses and crime scenes, she slips inside the psyche of the murderer and, subconsciously manipulated by Maro, Morana finally determines that in order to save the lives of more potential murder victims she must physically eliminate the all murder suspects… one by one.",[],3.86,"2,165 ratings",11 reviews,805,724,327,154,155
Agincourt,Bernard Cornwell,"Agincourt is one of the epic battles of history. It was fought by two badly matched armies that met in atrocious conditions on St Crispin's Day 1415, and resulted in an extraordinary victory that was celebrated in England long before Shakespeare immortalised it in Henry V. It has always been held to be the triumph of the longbow against the armoured knight, and of the common man against the feudal aristocrat, but those are history's myths. Bernard Cornwell, who has long wanted to write this story, depicts the reality behind the myths.Nicholas Hook is an English archer. He seems born to trouble and, when his lord orders him to London as part of a force sent to quell an expected Lollard uprising, Nick's headstrong behaviour leads to him being proscribed an outlaw. He finds refuge across the Channel, part of an English mercenary force protecting the town of Soissons against the French. What happened at the Siege of Soissons shocked all Europe, and propels Nick back to England where he is enrolled in the archer companyof the doughty Sir John Cornwaille, a leader of Henry V's army. The army was superb, but sickness and the unexpected French defiance at Harfleur, reduce it to near-shambolic condition. Henry stubbornly refuses to accept defeat and, in appalling weather, leads his shrunken force to what appears to be inevitable disaster.culminates in the battle. Seen from several points of view on the English side, but also from the French ranks, the scene is vivid, convincing and compelling. Bernard Cornwell has a great understanding of men at war and battlefields and this is his masterpiece. This is what it must have been like to fight at Agincourt.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'War', 'British Literature', 'France', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']",4.15,"29,230 ratings","1,752 reviews","11,750","11,626","4,671",851,332

Roots: The Saga of an American Family,Alex Haley,"When he was a boy in Henning, Tennessee, Alex Haley's grandmother used to tell him stories about their family—stories that went back to her grandparents, and their grandparents, down through the generations all the way to a man she called ""the African."" She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the ""Kamby Bolongo"" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins.

He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities.

Ebullient and perverse, he has seen off 3 wives - the enigmatic Clara, whom he drove to suicide in Paris in 1952; the garrulous Second Mrs Panofsky; and finally Miriam who stayed married to him for decades before running off with a sober academic. Houdini-like, Barney slides from crisis to success, from lowlife to highlife in Montreal, Paris and London, his outrageous expolits culminating in the scandal he carries around like a humpback - the murder charge that he goes on denying to the end.","['Fiction', 'Canada', 'Contemporary', 'Canadian Literature', 'Humor', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Jewish', 'Literature']",4.16,"12,204 ratings",890 reviews,"5,370","4,366","1,790",444,234

Painted Black,Debra R. Borys,"Painted Black is a novel about two Chicago street people, teenagers not even old enough to vote or fight for their country or drink a beer, legally that is. They’ve been kicked in the face, cursed and, worst of all, ignored and yet they continue to say screw you. They fight to survive, to thrive.Lexie Green has been selling herself for drug money ever since her mama kicked her out at thirteen. A dope sick street kid will do anything to get high again. Anything to scratch the itchy palms, ease the stomach cramps, control the vomiting. But when she’s asked to pose nude with a bizarre collection of freeze-dried corpses–the freak show seems too much to face alone.Christopher Robert Young, Cry for short, couldn’t use addiction as an excuse. He told himself he went with Lexie to keep her safe, that it had nothing to do with his struggle to avoid hustling along the harbor like Tito and the others. Selling blowjobs for forty bucks, however, pales in comparison to the macabre scene he finds at Sloan and Whiteside’s funeral home where they freeze dry the dead like special order pizzas.Until she met Lexie and Chris, reporter Jo Sullivan’s column at Winds of Change was just a job to pay the bills. But when the young girl, with her haunting eyes and eerie tale, disappears, Jo finds herself caught up in the lives of those homeless people she used to just write about. As she and Chris try to unravel the twisted mystery at Sloan and Whiteside’s, Jo can’t help comparing the dark heart of the city with the dark shadows in her own family’s past.",[],4.13,30 ratings,18 reviews,14,10,3,2,1
The Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer,"The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'School', 'Short Stories', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classic Literature', 'Read For School', 'High School']",3.52,"218,567 ratings","4,272 reviews","45,157","67,687","70,834","25,677","9,212"

While how and where the attack will take place are still unknown.This is a passage from ShadowThree hours later, he pulled into the park. At the far end of the lot, there was a solitary black Duango parked. As he approached it, he could tell it was running because of the warm exhaust rising from the tail pipe. The man inside looked like he was sleeping. Jim parked his T Bird and walked up to the driver's door. It was Wayne Russell all right, but he was in no position to talk. The driver's side window was shattered, and it was apparent that some one had placed a small caliber round through his temple. Probably a two twenty three, and at long range judging by the entrance wound. Jim turned looking behind him; there was a tree line on the other side of the road nearly two hundred yards away. Then looking at the parking lot he noticed where someone had pulled up here and walked around a vehicle to this same spot.Was he being watched right now he wondered. Reaching in he took an envelope that was pinned to Russell's coat, soaked in his blood. Looking back at the tree line he opened the envelope, the note simply said, YOU'RE NEXT, STAND DOWN.Walking briskly back to his car he looked around, it didn't appear anyone could have seen him, except maybe the shooter if he was still around. Jim got into the Thunderbird, spun it around in the snow, and hurried out of there.As he drove, he watched his rear view mirror, making sure he was not being followed. How did Kline know he was investigating he thought? This had to be Kline, that SOB, he thought. No wonder no one wants to talk.So he knew, that meant now more than ever it was important that he hurry, before Kline could clear the trail behind him.As the story continues readers are introduced to the team Jim heads. As they without his help continue to pursue the terrorist plot. While Jim Kelley goes after Kline. The reader is swept up in the chase as each new chapter unfolds.

My Pet Serial Killer,Michael J.

The first time I took someone for her I knew it was true. I was a taker. She told me she only loved the takers of this world. Of course, we all eventually get taken in the end. You know what I remember from that first time though? The sounds. It almost like the sound a baby makes when it’s sighing. That’s how quiet it is. I just kept needing that sound over and over again. So I took and I took and I took and I took and I took some more.“Of course, I couldn’t go deep enough for her in the end. She poured salt on me and I melted into nothing.“You know that old saying? She was the type of person who tells you that dragons don’t exist, and then she leads you to their caves. I never even really called her by her name even. I never really called her Claire. I just thought of her as god.

Royal Enigma,K.B.,"The unsettling politics of India and Nepal as a backdrop, where the popular leaders have to be assassinated mostly, Nawin lives through the Maoist-war in the country, bearing the hardship it caused to the ordinary people like him. He finally discovers how much his step-mother had helped him, when his mother has died recently, when he and his brother were too young. He also feels his helplessness for not being to support her, in her efforts to maintain her mentally-invalid son, at a late age. Also is described the rule of monarchy in Nepal, when it held the absolute power, and the royal massacre, which eliminated the entire family of the king. During the Maoist-war, the violence unleashed by them and counter-violence by the security forces too is dealt in fair-details. This book is an effort to define the socio-politics of the Indian subcontinent, through fiction, which has been remarkably violent--as far as one could remember.Epic and dramaticNepal is an enigma to outsiders but a new novel opens a stunning window into the country and its society. The Royal Enigma uniquely mixes fiction and fact to tell the epic story of the 2001 assassination of the Nepalese royal family and its ongoing impact on the people of Nepal. Chapters detailing actual events alternate with the fictional life of Nawin, his life a personal mirror on the larger tragic national events. The Royal Enigma tells a real life story in a very different and appealing way. For years, Nepal was savaged by a civil war. On one side were the King and the democratically elected government (not quite the same thing), on the other side were brutal Maoist revolutionaries who terrorized the countryside. After years of war, one night most of the Nepalese royal family was assassinated. The official story? The Crown Prince shot all of them and then himself because he could not marry the woman he loved. The story most Nepalese believe? The King was assassinated because he was secretly working with the Maoists to destroy the democratically elected government. The Royal Enigma presents all the known facts and theories behind the assassinations. It is a great novel for anyone interested in real life political conspiracies! The story of the civil war is paralleled by chapters focusing on the disruption and corruption it brought to Nepalese society. That story is personified in Nawin and his family and friends. He leaves his family responsibilities of looking after his step-mother and disabled half-brother, and instead becomes a pharmaceutical salesperson working from Kathmandu.

Beneath the Bamboo: A Vietnam War Story,Stan Taylor,"Excerpt:“I watched two point men take a 50-caliber machine gun bullet to the head, and watched the third being grabbed and taken behind enemy lines. Two of the enemy soldiers, which we often referred to as gooks, quickly came after me. As I quickly mowed them down with my automatic rifle, I crawled backwards away from the enemy gunfire, using my helmet to push sand in front of me as I went, which made it possible to look behind me. But as I looked back, I realized that my safety net was no longer safe. I saw my entire company falling like dominoes. Medics were running left and right, risking their lives to help others with bravery that even the most amazing soldier couldn’t hope to match. Some of the events I witnessed during that moment were beyond comprehension. I watched a young, courageous black medic take an 81-millimeter round to his head, and his whole body instantly turned to smoke. Young nineteen and twenty year old kids were crying like children, but fighting like someone had raped their sisters. So many things were going through my head at that moment, and in one single heartbeat I was overwhelmed with a flashback of my entire life. This is my story, from point A to B, of my life and times in the midst of hell on Earth.”",[],4.24,274 ratings,13 reviews,144,73,41,10,6

The Taste Of Metal,Joe Hnida,"""It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth, with my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal..."" - Robert Downey Jr.The drugs just sort of happened. It's not like I'd traveled to Denver, Colorado to become immersed in the burgeoning marijuana scene, although it was hard to avoid. When I showed up, the pot industry in the Rocky Mountains was booming and with the recent passing of Amendment 64, was on the tipping point of becoming revolutionary.Still, legal weed was the furthest thing from my mind on the day I abruptly quit my job at the office, cashed out my 401k retirement fund and hopped a plane from the east coast to the Mile High City. I did this under the false impression that it was to help out an old best friend who was in need, but really, it was all in the name of a forbidden love that I'd been repressing for years.I was only supposed to stay in Denver for a week, but when I met Reed, an Iraq war vet who managed a marijuana dispensary and smoked copious amounts of his product to deal with his PTSD symptoms, he hooked me up with a job delivering weed to dispensary patients, and my trip was perpetually extended.While I coped with the maddening futility that comes along with the wanting of something I couldn't have, I found myself escaping into a lifestyle entrenched in concerts, bars, drugs, and masochism, all set against the neon of Denver's notoriously wicked Colfax Avenue.What followed was a furious, chaotic journey through the emotional depths of a bittersweet addiction. And even though it nearly killed me, I grew to embrace it, I even begged for it; the precarious situations, the constant killing of time, the sleepless nights, the loneliness, the fear, the desire, the ache, the denial, the inconceivable belief that I could actually control the cravings and the constant longings and the endless capacity to never, ever get enough, while my haunted soul thumped in unison with my old heart, mercilessly demanding more and more and more and more...But I guess that's the whole point. I'm not even talking about the drugs anymore, at least not the ones you're thinking of.",[],3.79,34 ratings,6 reviews,14,5,10,4,1

One of them never left, still farming the family's land that's been tilled for generations. Others did leave, went farther afield to make good, with varying degrees of success; as a rock star, commodities trader, rodeo stud. And seamlessly woven into their patchwork is Beth, whose presence among them—both then and now—fuels the kind of passion one comes to expect of love songs and rivalries.Now all four are home, in hopes of finding what could be real purchase in the world. The result is a shared memory only half-recreated, riddled with culture clashes between people who desperately wish to see themselves as the unified tribe they remember, but are confronted with how things have, in fact, changed.There is conflict here between longtime buddies, between husbands and wives — told with writing that is, frankly, gut-wrenching, and even heartbreaking.

New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,Anonymous,"The Holy Bible is God’s written communication to all of us. We must study it to get to know its Author. (John 17:3; 2 Timothy 3:16) Within its pages, Jehovah God reveals his purpose for humans and for their earthly home.—Genesis 3:15; Revelation 21:3, 4.No other book has such an impact on people’s lives. The Bible inspires us to reflect Jehovah’s qualities of love, mercy, and compassion. It gives hope, helping people to endure even the worst suffering. And it continues to expose the elements of this world that are out of harmony with the perfect will of God.—Psalm 119:105; Hebrews 4:12; 1 John 2:15-17.Originally composed in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, the Bible has been translated, in whole or in part, into about 2,600 languages. It is by far the most widely translated and distributed book in history. We should expect nothing less. Bible prophecy states: “This good news of the Kingdom [the key message contained in the Bible] will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”—Matthew 24:14.Recognizing the importance of the Bible’s message, we have undertaken the revision of this text with a profound respect for the content of the Bible. We feel the full weight of our responsibility to convey its message accurately. This revised edition has built on the fine foundation laid in previous editions of the , a Bible that was first released more than 60 years ago. However, the English language has changed during the past half century. Such change prompted current members of the New World Bible Translation Committee to initiate this comprehensive revision. Our goal has been to produce a translation that is not only faithful to the original texts but also clear and easy to read. The Appendix articles , , and discuss some of the linguistic refinements that were made in this edition.Those who love Jehovah God and worship him desire an accurate, understandable translation of God’s Word. (1 Timothy 2:4) To that end, we have made this revision available in English, with the intention of translating it into as many languages as possible. It is our hope and prayer that you, dear reader, will find this edition of the Holy Scriptures beneficial as you endeavor to “seek God . . . and really find him.”—Acts 17:27.August 2013",[],4.74,701 ratings,66 reviews,637,13,14,8,29

With a robust absence of self-pity, she has defined the humiliating onset of ""invisibility"" that coincides with the onrushing pressures of parents, teenage kids, and a marriage gone flat, all while attempting to reinstate her perilous professional worth. It’s full of such quotable casual profundity on the female condition I couldn't read it without a pencil to underline the abundance of great lines. Get ready for Kate!” —Tina BrownAllison Pearson's brilliant debut novel, I Don't Know How She Does It, was a New York Times bestseller with four million copies sold around the world.

De Kooning: An American Master,Mark Stevens,"Willem de Kooning is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century, a true “painter’s painter” whose protean work continues to inspire many artists. In the thirties and forties, along with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock, he became a key figure in the revolutionary American movement of abstract expressionism. Of all the painters in that group, he worked the longest and was the most prolific, creating powerful, startling images well into the 1980s.The first major biography of de Kooning captures both the life and work of this complex, romantic figure in American culture. Ten years in the making, and based on previously unseen letters and documents as well as on hundreds of interviews, this is a fresh, richly detailed, and masterful portrait. The young de Kooning overcame an unstable, impoverished, and often violent early family life to enter the Academie in Rotterdam, where he learned both classic art and guild techniques. Arriving in New York as a stowaway from Holland in 1926, he underwent a long struggle to become a painter and an American, developing a passionate friendship with his fellow immigrant Arshile Gorky, who was both a mentor and an inspiration. During the Depression, de Kooning emerged as a central figure in the bohemian world of downtown New York, surviving by doing commercial work and painting murals for the WPA. His first show at the Egan Gallery in 1948 was a revelation. Soon, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess were championing his work, and de Kooning took his place as the charismatic leader of the New York school—just as American art began to dominate the international scene.Dashingly handsome and treated like a movie star on the streets of downtown New York, de Kooning had a tumultuous marriage to Elaine de Kooning, herself a fascinating character of the period. At the height of his fame, he spent his days painting powerful abstractions and intense, disturbing pictures of the female figure—and his nights living on the edge, drinking, womanizing, and talking at the Cedar bar with such friends as Franz Kline and Frank O’Hara. By the 1960s, exhausted by the feverish art world, he retreated to the Springs on Long Island, where he painted an extraordinary series of lush pastorals. In the 1980s, as he slowly declined into what was almost certainly Alzheimer’s, he created a vast body of haunting and ethereal late work.This is an authoritative and brilliant exploration of the art, life, and world of an American master.",[],4.12,"2,866 ratings",126 reviews,"1,329",821,511,149,56

Jean de Florette,Marcel Pagnol,"Au village des Bastides Blanches, on hait ceux de Crespin.

Ce qui facilite les manœuvres des Soubevran, le Papet et son neveu Ugolin. qui veulent lui racheter son domaine à bas prix... Jean de Florette (1962), premier volume de L'Eau des collines, marque, trente ans après Pirouettes, le retour de Pagnol au roman. C'est l'épopée de l'eau nourricière sans laquelle rien n'est possible. Marcel Pagnol y développe l'histoire du père de Manon, évoquée sous forme de flash-back dans le filin Manon des sources (1952). Les dialogues sont savoureux, et la prose aussi limpide que dans les Souvenirs d'enfance. Quant au Papet et à Ugolin, à la fois drôles et terrifiants, ils sont parmi les créations les plus complexes de Pagnol.

So Gorgeous It Hurts,Katherine Caron,"SHE WAS HIS SICKNESS AND THE CUREI thought I’d write a little story about an insomniac war doctor with addiction issues and a kink for sedation and white asparagus, however it turned into so much more. Inspired by 9/11, a soul searing romance I’ve been thinking about for years, and the sickening truth that almost ALL of war’s victims are ordinary people, Dr. Cole Moreau's journey to redemption became so much more than an amuse bouche for me to nibble on weekends.I became fascinated by the volunteers and medical folks and peace warriors involved in humanitarian aid. I began to wonder about drugs and medicines and rogue profits. About mothers and women, the beauty we hide and promote. The steps we take, how we treat ourselves before a romance ever begins.A recurring theme kept cropping up. Your biggest strength is often your biggest weakness. I was thinking about poppies and morphine, fighting over resources that make a few rich and many very poor.In the center of all of these musings was Cole Moreau. How does recursion effect a haunted man with good in his heart, but a past no one should ever share? A culture rich in traditions, but sexist to the core? I was hooked. Research and connecting with people consumed me, and I can only hope readers love Cole as much as I do.Below is just a little taste to savor, as would Cole.Dr. Nicolas Moreau, a gifted anesthesiologist, world famous for his work in conflict zones, harbors dark secrets. His detached methods for coping begin to unravel with unintended consequences and death when he falls for his mysterious new neighbor. He's torn between embracing their connection or destroying it. As his grim past reveals itself, she can never know his dark life. Can he know hers?A battle for love born out of recovery and loss, bound in obsession and memory.I love reading and writing about fractured souls, the comfort they seek, and the broken people they love and torture. Suspense, medicine and romance move me, and I love to read stories set amidst modern times that magnify our differences. In my own work, I explore the distance between solitary lives of longing and safety and the connected lives of those who expose their flaws and let their vulnerability bleed out.",[],4.50,12 ratings,0 reviews,10,0,1,0,1

The Portrait of a Mirror,A. Natasha Joukovsky,"A stunning reinvention of the myth of Narcissus as a modern novel of manners, about two young, well-heeled couples whose parallel lives intertwine over the course of a summer, by a sharp new voice in fiction.Wes and Diana are the kind of privileged, well-educated, self-involved New Yorkers you may not want to like but can't help wanting to like you. With his boyish good looks, blue-blood pedigree, and the recent tidy valuation of his tech startup, Wes would have made any woman weak in the knees—any woman, that is, except perhaps his wife. Brilliant to the point of cunning, Diana possesses her own arsenal of charms, handily deployed against Wes in their constant wars of will and rhetorical sparring.Vivien and Dale live in Philadelphia, but with ties to the same prep schools and management consulting firms as Wes and Diana, they’re of the same ilk. With a wedding date on the horizon and carefully curated life of coupledom, Vivien and Dale make a picture-perfect pair on Instagram. But when Vivien becomes a visiting curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art just as Diana is starting a new consulting project in Philadelphia, the two couples’ lives cross and tangle. It’s the summer of 2015 and they’re all enraptured by one another and too engulfed in desire to know what they want—despite knowing just how to act.In this wickedly fun debut, A. Natasha Joukovsky crafts an absorbing portrait of modern romance, rousing real sympathy for these flawed characters even as she skewers them. Shrewdly observed, whip-smart, and shot through with wit and good humor, is a piercing exploration of narcissism, desire, self-delusion, and the great mythology of love.","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mythology', 'Literary Fiction', 'Retellings', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels']",3.63,"2,643 ratings",489 reviews,610,899,765,283,86

Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,Edmund Morris,"""This book, the only biography ever authorized by a sitting President - yet written with complete interpretive freedom - is as revolutionary in method as it is formidable in scholarship. When Ronald Reagan moved into the White House in 1981, one of his first literary guests was Edmund Morris, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Theodore Roosevelt. Morris developed a fascination for the genial yet inscrutable President and, after Reagan's landslide reelection in 1984, put aside the second volume of his life of Roosevelt to become an observing eye and ear at the White House.""Coming and going with Reagan's benign approval ('I'm not going to charge up San Juan Hill for you'), Morris found the President to be a man of extraordinary power and mystery. Although the historic early achievements were plain to see - the restoration of American optimism and patriotism, a repowering of the national economy, a massive arms buildup deliberately forcing the 'Evil Empire' of Soviet Communism to come to terms - nobody, let alone Reagan himself, could explain how he succeeded in shaping events to his will. And when Reagan's second term came to grips with some of the most fundamental moral issues of the late twentieth century - at Bitburg and Bergen-Belsen, at Geneva and Reykajavik, publicly outside the Brandenburg Gate ('Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'), and deep within the mother monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church, Morris realized that he had taken on a subject of epic dimensions.""Thus began a long biographical pilgrimage to the heart of Ronald Reagan's mystery, beginning with his birth in 1911 in the depths of rural Illinois (where he is still remembered as 'Dutch,' the dreamy son of an alcoholic father and a fiercely religious mother) and progressing through the way stations of an amazingly varied career: young lifeguard (he saved seventy-seven lives), aspiring writer, ace sportscaster, film star, soldier, union leader, corporate spokesman, Governor, and President. Reagan granted Morris full access to his personal papers, including early autobiographical stories and a handwritten White House diary.""","['Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Presidents', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Us Presidents', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Historical']",3.56,"2,320 ratings",161 reviews,590,677,654,235,164

Like John Irving and Richard Yates, Udall creates characters that engage us to the fullest as they grapple with the nature of need, love, and belonging.Beautifully written, keenly observed, and ultimately redemptive, The Lonely Polygamist is an unforgettable story of an American family—with its inevitable dysfunctionality, heartbreak, and comedy—pushed to its outer limits.","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Polygamy', 'Religion', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Book Club', 'Family']",3.52,"15,247 ratings","2,652 reviews","2,628","5,676","4,558","1,763",622

The Baby Killers,Jay Lake,"""Within our tale, gentle reader, you will see writ before you a palimpsest of low living and high misdemeanor, and the curious redresses that are visited as a result thereof . . .""In The Baby Killers, Jay Lake restages mankind's Fall from Grace as an alternate-history steampunk fable. Written in a style of rambunctious Victoriana-that-never-was, this novella is set in Philadelphia in 1907, when that city serves as the seat of the British Dominion of the Americas, and as a Pandora's Box of sin and vice. The Governor-General has a taste for violating innocents, while the good Dr. Scholes uses them to fashion his mechanized agents of Justice. The Gollinoster, a feminine incarnation of angry retribution, wanders beneath the city streets - and an undying creature of ancient destruction is rushing to meet her. Villains and heroes (categories that overlap significantly) battle in a story of debauchery, degradation, radical experimentation, mad metaphysics . . . and a farting Frenchman.Both popular culture and actual history are mined here to create a tale in which the use of idealized technology meets our darkest desires . . . and the result is positively electric.",[],4.28,29 ratings,1 review,18,4,4,3,0

Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament,Kay Redfield Jamison,"The definitive work on the profound and surprising links between manic-depression and creativity, from the bestselling psychologist of bipolar disorders who wrote An Unquiet Mind.One of the foremost psychologists in America, “Kay Jamison is plainly among the few who have a profound understanding of the relationship that exists between art and madness” (William Styron).The anguished and volatile intensity associated with the artistic temperament was once thought to be a symptom of genius or eccentricity peculiar to artists, writers, and musicians. Her work, based on her study as a clinical psychologist and researcher in mood disorders, reveals that many artists subject to exalted highs and despairing lows were in fact engaged in a struggle with clinically identifiable manic-depressive illness.Jamison presents proof of the biological foundations of this disease and applies what is known about the illness to the lives and works of some of the world's greatest artists including Lord Byron, Vincent Van Gogh, and Virginia Woolf.","['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Illness', 'Art', 'Science', 'History', 'Health', 'Psychiatry', 'Biography']",4.03,"5,010 ratings",259 reviews,"1,863","1,806","1,034",227,80

Ric Flair: To Be the Man,Ric Flair,"""Woooooo! ™""With that triumphant cry, ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair surpassed his predecessors and his peers to become one of the greatest professional wrestlers in history.To wrestling fans, the Nature Boy is a platinum-blond deity. A sixteen-time World Champion, ""Slick Ric"" could convince television viewers that a momentous life experience would pass them by if they missed an upcoming match. His opponents were challenged with this simple ""To be the man, you have to beat the man.""From the moment he was born, Richard Morgan Fliehr was enmeshed in controversy. Like many of the other children adopted through the Tennessee Children's Home Society, he had apparently been stolen from his birth parents. Raised just outside Minneapolis, Ric was a distracted student, a brilliant athlete, and a wild party boy. Then, a chance meeting with Olympic weightlifter Ken Patera, directed Flair to the world of professional wrestling.In 1974, Flair relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, igniting the Mid-Atlantic Wrestling promotion. He was almost forced to retire a year later when his back was broken in a plane crash. Flair recuperated, and in 1981 he would win his first National Wrestling Alliance championship. As the most traveled champion ever, he once wrestled eighteen hour-long cards during a fourteen-day stretch.Before purchasing World Championship Wrestling in 1988, Ted Turner was given assurance that the Nature Boy would come with the package. But Flair's clashes with WCW management would drive him to World Wrestling Entertainment. When he later returned to WCW, Flair collided in and out of the ring with Hulk Hogan and -- as the company disintegrated -- began losing his self-esteem.Arriving back at WWE in 2001, Flair was a broken man. What he didn't realize was that wrestlers who'd grown up idolizing him now inhabited the locker room. With their support, he was finally able to claim his legacy and receive the credit he so richly deserved.To Be the Man traces the rise of one of wrestling's most enduring superstars to the pinnacle of the sports entertainment universe, and is a must-read for every wrestling fan.",[],3.90,"2,466 ratings",137 reviews,765,888,645,142,26

Timbuctoo,Tahir Shah,"For centuries, the greatest explorers of their age were dispatched from the power-houses of Europe London, Paris and Berlin on a quest unlike any To be the first white Christian to visit, and then to sack, the fabled metropolis of Timbuctoo. Most of them never returned alive. At the height of the Timbuctoo mania, two hundred years ago, it was widely believed that the elusive Saharan city was fashioned in entirety from the purest gold everything from the buildings to the cobble-stones, from the buckets to the bedsteads was said to be made from it. One winter night in 1815, a young illiterate American seaman named Robert Adams was discovered half-naked and starving on the snow-bound streets of London. His skin seared from years in the African desert, he claimed to have been a guest of the King of Timbuctoo. Thought of an American claiming anything let alone the greatest prize in exploration was abhorrent in the extreme. Closing ranks against their unwelcome American guest, the British Establishment lampooned his tale, and began a campaign of discrediting him, one that continues even today. An astonishing tale based on true-life endurance, Tahir Shah s epic novel Timbuctoo brilliantly recreates the obsessions of the time, as a backdrop for one of the greatest love stories ever told. Timbuctoo will be released on June 28, 2012. This is a limited edition hardback, very very high spec, and designed along the lines of the travel books of two centuries ago. It weighs 2 kilos (almost 4.5 lbs), has fabulous marbled endpapers, a silk bookmark, a pouch at the rear with inserts, and six huge fold-out maps. The paper is wood-free, and the cover embossed with raised gold type. In addition, each copy contains the clues needed to begin a treasure hunt that could result in locating one of four golden treasures of Timbuctoo. The book is a thing of extraordinary beauty, and the kind of book that will last two hundred years or more.",[],3.84,"1,667 ratings",66 reviews,622,539,244,134,128

She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school’s glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel.As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of–and, ultimately, a participant in–their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she’s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered.Ultimately, Lee’s experiences–complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.","['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Boarding School', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction']",3.42,"68,779 ratings","5,582 reviews","11,815","21,921","22,210","9,317","3,516"

The Beckoning West,T.R. Wallace,"In 1800 Jonathan Williams dreamed of a life in the new world while working in his masters print shop. The new world a place he had read about, where a man could make his own way. A new land where trapping was a profitable and adventurous way to advance ones wealth. That year he boarded a Yankee ship and worked his way across to New York. Outfitted as best he could he trekked off toward the Canadian territory in search of his dream. Along the way to that dream he met new friends, faced his own fears, and grew into a man. Together with his partner Jacques they travel to the shores of Lake Superior to establish their trade business and trapping headquarters. But the rugged forbidding hills hide the dangers of the forest. As the men carve out a future while fighting the elements,Indians, and for Jonathan, his own fears.Here is an excerpt from the book. When they reached the top there were eight of the war party closing on them. This time it was Johnathan's turn and he fired and traded rifles with Jacques. But before he could fire the second shot a ball ripped into his left shoulder. Grimacing in pain he raised the rifle and fired as Hawk pushed him aside and fired. Jacques grabbed a handful of his hide shirt and pulled him away. After dragging him a safe distance away from the top Jacques went back to help Hawk. Hawk in the meantime had dropped his rifle and was forcing them back as he fought with his tomahawk in one hand and knife in the other. As Jacques again started firing the Huron turned and retreated down the trail. Laughing Jacques said “they will be back but not that way ehh? Then walking over to Jonathan he pulled the neck of the hide shirt over so he could look at the wound. You bleed good Englishman, how about Jacques make it stop ehh? Carefully he poured powder into the wound then he said, turn your face away my friend. Then he dry fired the rifle holding the lock near the powder. There was a flash as the smell of burning flesh and powder filled the air along with Jonathan's scream of agony. I am sorry mon ami, but it had to be done, he said as Jonathan passed out. As Jonathan lay there Hawk took a look over the top and scouted behind them. Jacques watched the front where he could see them regrouping below amongst the trees at the rivers edge. There had to be at least fifteen maybe twenty not counting those guarding the prisoners. The only thing in their favor at the moment was several hours of sunlight. If the Chippewa failed to catch up by evening they would have to give up the fight and sneak out of there. A shot came from the other side and Jacques gabbed his rifle and ran to help Hawk. It had only taken the Huron a few minutes to do just as Jonathan thought they would. As rifle fire erupted behind the ledge Jonathan slowly swam out of unconsciousness. As he did so he grabbed his rifle and reloaded it. The pain from his shoulder was intense, but the will to live was stronger. As he finished reloading he saw a Huron warrior carefully coming to the top of the trail. Seeing Jonathan down on the ground he and the two with him screamed and lunged forward. Jonathan pulled the hammer back and fired, dropping the first man in front of his party. Undeterred the others kept coming. Jonathan stood though his head spun, and fired point blank at the nearest man with his pistol, hitting him in the forehead. Then he switched hands with the pistol holding it by the barrel and took his knife in his right hand. The last Huron paused a second realizing the wounded man had just easily killed two of his brothers. Then he let out a wild cry and charged forward. But he fell as if tripped. Then Jonathan saw the tomahawk lodged in his back, as Jacques ran back onto the ledge. “Are you okay mon ami”, Jacques asked as he pulled the tomahawk from the mans back then took a quick look down the trail? Smiling Johnathan said, “never felt better”, as he passed out again.",[],4.50,4 ratings,1 review,3,0,1,0,0

Sylvie,Gérard de Nerval,"The story is about a hero's love for three women, all of whom he loses; a hymn to unattainable, unrequited love. The story begins when a paragraph in a newspaper plunges the narrator into his memories as a younger man. The perspective seems to shift back and forth between the past and present, so the reader is never entirely sure if the narrator is recounting past events from memory, or retelling current events as they happen. Critics have praised the writing for its lucid and lyrical style. The narrator, of noble status who has recently come into an inheritance, decides to leave Paris, where he is living a debauched life of theater and drink, and return to the love of his youth, a peasant girl named Sylvie who has classic features and brunette hair, a ""timeless ideal"". She sows gloves for a living and ends up marrying another man more equal to her class. The narrator also loves a seductive actress in Paris named Aurelia, who has many suitors who tell her empty idylls of love, but none love her for who she really is, including the narrator, who sees her as a lovely illusion that fades in the daylight of reality. The narrator also loves Adrienne, of noble birth, tall with blonde hair, she is an ""ideal beauty"", but she lives in a convent, and dies an early death. In the end he loves all three but obtains none, seemingly for reasons both beyond and within his making.","['France', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'French Literature', 'Novels', '19th Century', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Novella']",3.59,"1,351 ratings",105 reviews,289,457,405,160,40

Face Of Our Father,G. Egore Pitir,"Pitir does it again! Some authors speak of genre bending, some authors prove it. After winning the 2015 Best Indie Book Award for Action/Adventure and receiving the B.R.A.G. Medallion, FACE OF OUR FATHER was just awarded the Bronze Medal for Popular Fiction by the 2016 eLit Awards.This novel has it all. One part ""The Bourne Identity,"" one part ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" and one part ""The Notebook,"" this poignant tale leaves the reader haunted by its characters long after the novel's final page has turned. Stuart and Angela Pierce, like many disillusioned careerists, are busy reinventing their lives. Stu reduces his airline flying schedule to train for triathlons, while Angie escapes the daily horrors of a prosecutor’s job to pursue pro bono work. But death threats soon prove that the only thing Angie escaped was the protective arm of the District Attorney’s office. With a graphic photo of a ritual stoning Stu’s only tangible clue, he sets out to protect a wife who refuses to protect herself. Obsessed with catching a murdering rapist, Angie plunges them both into a web of global intrigue. But who, indeed what, is the real enemy? Honor. Love. Life.

To get at all that, a novel needs a rollercoaster of a plot coupled with an acute understanding of identity, love, and where these intersect. Test your beliefs.

The Gates of Rome,Conn Iggulden,"Rarely, if ever, does a new writer dazzle us with such a vivid imagination and storytelling, flawlessly capturing the essence of a land, a people, a legend. Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on Julius Caesar.On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family–and his adoptive brother–will be the most powerful force in his life.As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat–under the tutelage of one of Rome’s most fearsome gladiators–Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier’s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict–a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test.Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts–from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.From the Hardcover edition.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Roman', 'War', 'Italy', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Audiobook']",4.19,"27,440 ratings","1,147 reviews","11,739","10,584","3,929",832,356

Primitives of Kar,Dennis K. Hausker,"Tragedy strikes the village when girls are kidnapped and elders are killed and brutalized while the warriors are out hunting, and the bulk of the tribe has moved to the winter camp. It's the beginning of a strange tale which evolves and changes as the story goes on. They start with questions and each step they take seems to increase the problems without providing any answers. Trying to assess the unseen enemy and defend their people and lands from an unprecedented threat, it soon expands beyond their borders and involves neighboring peoples. ""Primitives of Kar"" represents the start of the story. They are primitive, but the Vikar are not stupid. It merely reflects where they are in their stage of development. Korban is a fierce warrior, but he's also a decent man. Meeting Princess Lanai was a huge factor in his life, and was somewhat traumatic. Saving her life drew her notice, but that didn't mean it would be smooth sailing with her. Quite the opposite. She seemed to have a knack for evoking him, for as much as he tried to fight it. He'd never met a woman like her. The danger, the continuing increase of attacks spanning the continent left no time to ponder. The extent of the peril never lessened and trying to cope with each different situation took more than just courage. They had to learn to adapt and that meant finding ways to cooperate with unfriendly neighbors. Korban had never sought notoriety, attention, and certainly not leadership, but they followed him around nonetheless. Where this would ultimately lead, nobody had any idea. The shocking developments that the future held were daunting, and even survival was in doubt.",[],4.40,169 ratings,4 reviews,89,68,4,6,2

Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia,Jean Sasson,"Sultana is a Saudi Arabian princess, a woman born to fabulous, uncountable wealth. She has four mansions on three continents, her own private jet, glittering jewels, designer dresses galore. But in reality she lives in a gilded cage. She has no freedom, no control over her own life, no value but as a bearer of sons. Hidden behind her black floor-length veil, she is a prisoner, jailed by her father, her husband, her sons, and her country.Sultana is a member of the Saudi royal family, closely related to the king. For the sake of her daughters, she has decided to take the risk of speaking out about the life of women in her country, regardless of their rank. She must hide her identity for fear that the religious leaders in her country would call for her death to punish her honesty. Only a woman in her position could possibly hope to escape from being revealed and punished, despite her cloak and anonymity. Sultana tells of her own life, from her turbulent childhood to her arranged marriage--a happy one until her husband decided to displace her by taking a second wife--and of the lives of her sisters, her friends and her servants. Although they share affection, confidences and an easy camaraderie within the confines of the women's quarters, they also share a history of appalling oppression, everyday occurrences that in any other culture would be seen as shocking human rights violations; thirteen-year-old girls forced to marry men five times their age, young women killed by drowning, stoning, or isolation in the women's room, a padded, windowless cell where women are confined with neither light nor conversation until death claims them.By speaking out, Sultana risks bringing the wrath of the Saudi establishment upon her head and the heads of her children. But by telling her story to Jean Sasson, Sultana has allowed us to see beyond the veils of this secret society, to the heart of a nation where sex, money, and power reign supreme.","['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Feminism', 'Womens', 'Religion', 'Islam', 'Autobiography']",4.02,"37,303 ratings","2,836 reviews","13,686","13,978","7,114","1,734",791

Dead I Well May Be,Adrian McKinty,"This Irish bad-boy thriller -- set in the hardest streets of New York City -- brims with violence, greed, and sexual betrayal.""I didn't want to go to America, I didn't want to work for Darkey White. I had my reasons. But I went.""So admits Michael Forsythe, an illegal immigrant escaping the Troubles in Belfast. But young Michael is strong and fearless and clever -- just the fellow to be tapped by Darkey, a crime boss, to join a gang of Irish thugs struggling against the rising Dominican powers in Harlem and the Bronx. The time is pre-Giuliani New York, when crack rules the city, squatters live furtively in ruined buildings, and hundreds are murdered each month. Michael and his lads tumble through the streets, shaking down victims, drinking hard, and fighting for turf, block by bloody block.Dodgy and observant, not to mention handy with a pistol, Michael is soon anointed by Darkey as his rising star. Meanwhile Michael has very inadvisably seduced Darkey's girl, Bridget -- saucy, fickle, and irresistible. Michael worries that he's being followed, that his affair with Bridget will be revealed. He's right to be anxious; when Darkey discovers the affair, he plans a very hard fall for young Michael, a gambit devilish in its guile, murderous in its intent.But Darkey fails to account for Michael's toughness and ingenuity or the possibility that he might wreak terrible vengeance upon those who would betray him.A natural storyteller with a gift for dialogue, McKinty introduces to readers a stunning new noir voice, dark and stylish, mythic and violent -- complete with an Irish lilt.","['Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Ireland', 'Irish Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Noir', 'Suspense']",3.96,"4,200 ratings",422 reviews,"1,326","1,741",845,200,88

2005 - Thanks for the Vodka,Harpie,"If you only read one book this year, make it this oneYou won’t find another book like this anywhere elseThere are books that discuss mental illness and there are books that discuss self-harm, but only from a clinical viewpoint; as in what to do if your child is one of these ‘Emo children, making pathetic little cat scratches on their arms and flaunting what they’re doing to the rest of the world.’You may even find a few fiction books, mostly in the Young Adult genre, whereby the hero or heroine cuts themselves due to home or school issues or even peer pressure.But nobody, ever, has had the bravery – until now – to tell it like it really is. Nobody has discussed the deep shame, the reasons behind self-mutilation and how this way of confronting emotional pain, acute anger or resentment is reasoned.It’s not a joke. Neither is mental illness or depression. You wouldn’t say ‘snap out of it’ to somebody with cancer, diabetes or heart disease, so what makes people feel its okay to say the same to those with depression?Previous comments on Harpie’s writing are that she “reveals her innermost thoughts, slashing a metaphoric vein and bleeding onto the page.” And those words were chosen for a reason. Harpie writes with her heart on her sleeve. She is emotionally transparent. Her feelings are as clear as the scars on her arms and legs. But the message here is that there are some scars that are never seen.This book’s not all messed up. It’s a year in the life of a working class hero who’s come to be loved by many of her fans. In ‘2005 – Thanks for the Vodka’ Harpie describes her sexual liaisons, bullying, court dates, her career as a zoo keeper, the NHS and those beautiful people who some regard as mentally unstable. And she does all this with that charming, self-deprecating sense of humour synonymous of her style of writing.As always when Harpie writes, this is a book of raw emotion ….

The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires,Grady Hendrix,"Fried Green Tomatoes and Steel Magnolias meet Dracula in this Southern-flavored supernatural thriller set in the '90s about a women's book club that must protect its suburban community from a mysterious and handsome stranger who turns out to be a blood-sucking fiend.Patricia Campbell had always planned for a big life, but after giving up her career as a nurse to marry an ambitious doctor and become a mother, Patricia's life has never felt smaller. The days are long, her kids are ungrateful, her husband is distant, and her to-do list is never really done. The one thing she has to look forward to is her book club, a group of Charleston mothers united only by their love for true-crime and suspenseful fiction. In these meetings, they're more likely to discuss the FBI's recent siege of Waco as much as the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood.But when an artistic and sensitive stranger moves into the neighborhood, the book club's meetings turn into speculation about the newcomer. Patricia is initially attracted to him, but when some local children go missing, she starts to suspect the newcomer is involved. She begins her own investigation, assuming that he's a Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy. What she uncovers is far more terrifying, and soon she--and her book club--are the only people standing between the monster they've invited into their homes and their unsuspecting community.","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Vampires', 'Audiobook', 'Thriller', 'Paranormal', 'Adult', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']",3.81,"203,290 ratings","30,652 reviews","53,454","82,237","47,452","14,800","5,347"

Her parents called her Dorcas, but he called her Campion and that's what she longed to be, then and forever. She had one gift left for her by her unknown father - a pendant made of gold, banded by tiny glowing stones and at its base was a seal engraved with an axe and the words: St Matthew. So when she flees before the unbearable, worthy suitor who is forced upon her after her forbidden meeting, she takes this and the delicate lace gloves with her, and hopes to find her father, and her lover. There are four of these intricately wrought seals - each owned by a stranger, each holding a secret within. And when all four seals are united, then the holder will have access to great wealth and power. That is Campion's inheritance. But to claim this and find again her summer love, she must follow the course her father's legacy charts for her.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'British Literature', '17th Century', 'Mystery', 'Civil War', '20th Century', 'Audiobook']",3.97,"2,552 ratings",138 reviews,974,831,510,162,75

Nijura: Das Erbe der Elfenkrone,Jenny-Mai Nuyen,"Über den Marschen von Korr liegt dichter Nebel. So kommt es, dass die Moorelfen den verhüllten Besucher ihres Dorfes erst spät erkennen.

Gemeinsam mit dem Menschenjungen Scapa und dem Elfenprinzen Kaveh nimmt sie die Herausforderung an .... Das Romandebüt Nijura. Das Erbe der Elfenkrone der deutsch-vietnamesischen Autorin Jenny-Mai Nuyen ist ein Phänomen. Denn seine Autorin ist gerade einmal 18 Jahre alt. Zwei Jahre hat Nuyen, die inzwischen an der New York University Film studiert, an ihrem Epos geschrieben, und die brillante Reife des Buchs ist wohl nur darauf zurück zu führen, dass das Fantasy-Genre eines ist, das mit allerlei tradierten Mustern, Versatzstücken von Mythen und einem festgelegten Repertoire an Figuren die bestmögliche Wirkung zu erzielen vermag. Natürlich hat sich auch Nuyen durch die ganze Parallelwelt der Elfen, Irrlichter, Gnomen, Riesen und Drachen hindurch gelesen. Und trotzdem besteht die Kunst ja gerade darin, wieder etwas völlig neues aus dem Hexenkessel bekannter Zutaten zu zaubern. Mit Nijura. Das Erbe der Elfenkrone ist Nuyen dies auf jeden Fall gelungen. Andere Vertreter des Genres mögen älter sein. Aber Nuyen ist deutlich besser als ein Großteil von ihnen. Für Leser ab zwölf Jahren. --Isa Gerck","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'High Fantasy', 'German Literature', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'Elves', 'Adventure', 'Novels']",3.74,"1,827 ratings",73 reviews,517,606,480,169,55

The Ledge: An Adventure Story of Friendship and Survival on Mount Rainier,Jim Davidson,"“My eyes travel up the frozen walls. I figure it is eighty feet up to the sunlight. The walls above me climb up at about eighty degrees, then they go dead vertical, and then, higher up, they overhang. It is as if I am looking out from the belly of a beast, its jagged white teeth interlocking above me.” In June 1992, best friends Jim Davidson and Mike Price stood triumphantly atop Washington’s Mount Rainier, celebrating what they hoped would be the first of many milestones in their lives as passionate young mountaineers. Instead, their conquest gave way to catastrophe when a cave-in plunged them deep inside a glacial crevasse—the pitch-black, ice-walled hell that every climber’s nightmares are made of.An avid adventurer from an early age, Davidson was already a seasoned climber at the time of the Rainier ascent, fully aware of the risks and hopelessly in love with the challenge. But in the blur of a harrowing free fall, he suddenly found himself challenged by nature’s grandeur at its most unforgiving. Trapped on a narrow, unstable frozen ledge, deep below daylight and high above a yawning chasm, he would desperately battle crumbling ice and snow that threatened to bury him alive, while struggling in vain to save his fatally injured companion. And finally, with little equipment, no partner, and rapidly dwindling hope, he would have to make a fateful choice—between the certainty of a slow, lonely death or the seeming impossibility of climbing for his life.At once a heart-stopping adventure story, a heartfelt memoir of friendship, and a stirring meditation on fleeting mortality and immutable nature, The Ledge chronicles one man’s transforming odyssey from the dizzying heights of elation and awe to the punishing depths of grief and hard-won wisdom. This book’s visceral, lyrical prose sings the praises of the physical world’s wonders, while searching the souls of those willing, for better or worse, to fully embrace it.","['Nonfiction', 'Adventure', 'Mountaineering', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Survival', 'Climbing', 'Autobiography', 'Outdoors']",3.93,"1,751 ratings",229 reviews,521,694,437,84,15

Brave, independent, and a lifelong rebel against her country's conservative, patriarchal society, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was temperamentally made for the job. Her group's name was Alliance, but the Gestapo dubbed it Noah's Ark because its agents used the names of animals as their aliases. Marie-Madeleine's codename was Hedgehog.No other French spy network lasted as long or supplied as much crucial intelligence as Alliance--and as a result, the Gestapo pursued them relentlessly, capturing, torturing, and executing hundreds of its three thousand agents, including her own lover and many of her key spies. Fourcade had to move her headquarters every week, constantly changing her hair color, clothing, and identity, yet was still imprisoned twice by the Nazis. Both times she managed to escape, once by stripping naked and forcing her thin body through the bars of her cell. The mother of two young children, Marie-Madeleine hardly saw them during the war, so entirely engaged was she in her spy network, preferring they live far from her and out of harm's way.In , Lynne Olson tells the tense, fascinating story of Fourcade and Alliance against the background of the developing war that split France in two and forced its citizens to live side by side with their hated German occupiers.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'France', 'War', 'Espionage', 'Historical', 'Womens', 'Audiobook']",4.22,"7,428 ratings","1,066 reviews","3,214","2,965","1,004",166,79

In a Free State,V.S. Naipaul,"No writer has rendered our boundariless, post-colonial world more acutely or prophetically than V. S. Naipaul, or given its upheavals such a hauntingly human face. A perfect case in point is this riveting novel, a masterful and stylishly rendered narrative of emigration, dislocation, and dread, accompanied by four supporting narratives.In the beginning it is just a car trip through Africa. Two English people--Bobby, a civil servant with a guilty appetite for African boys, and Linda, a supercilious compound wife -- are driving back to their enclave after a stay in the capital. But in between lies the landscape of an unnamed country whose squalor and ethnic bloodletting suggest Idi Amin's Uganda. And the farther Naipaul's protagonists travel into it, the more they find themselves crossing the line that separates privileged outsiders from horrified victims. Alongside this Conradian tour de force are four incisive portraits of men seeking liberation far from home. By turns funny and terrifying, sorrowful and unsparing, In A Free State is Naipaul at his best.","['Fiction', 'Africa', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'India', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']",3.49,"4,893 ratings",402 reviews,823,"1,656","1,681",564,169

Deployed Flight and Sometimes Eternity,Ronnie Smith,"This book is a collection of poems describing experiences of military missions spanning 25 years of flying in the US Air Force; flown to Africa, Antarctica, war torn Bosnia, and other places around the world. It casts spiritual light onto the graphics of military flying. The poems underscore the fact that there is a bright seam to life in not only what we do, which can appear as drudgery, but as a result of the intention one holds in doing the work.The poet takes a 50,000 foot view of the world, and translates the everyday flights of US Airmen and places them in the all too human landscape. He juxtaposes their roles with the plight of every human being, trying to make the world a better place by succeeding at their mission. Missions are sometimes dangerous and are planned to the finest detail to cover all contingencies. But at the same time, all are filled with potential to escalate into something we never thought about psychologically. It is this translation of the 'surprise of reality' that the poet describes and connects through the eyes of the operator, the flier, out in the field, hacking the mission for God and country.",[],4.11,125 ratings,0 reviews,54,47,12,8,4

Ripley",Neal Thompson,"*An Amazon Best Book of the Month*A Barnes & Noble Booksellers' Pick*An NPR pick for 2013*A Vanity Fair Hot Type pick*A Publishers Lunch Buzz Book 2013*An iTunes/iBookstore Best Book of the Month*A Parade magazine 2013 Summer ReadA Curious Man is the marvelously compelling biography of Robert “Believe It or Not” Ripley, the enigmatic cartoonist turned globetrotting millionaire who won international fame by celebrating the world's strangest oddities, and whose outrageous showmanship taught us to believe in the unbelievable.As portrayed by acclaimed biographer Neal Thompson, Ripley’s life is the stuff of a classic American fairy tale. Buck-toothed and cursed by shyness, Ripley turned his sense of being an outsider into an appreciation for the strangeness of the world. After selling his first cartoon to Time magazine at age eighteen, more cartooning triumphs followed, but it was his “Believe It or Not” conceit and the wildly popular radio shows it birthed that would make him one of the most successful entertainment figures of his time and spur him to search the globe’s farthest corners for bizarre facts, exotic human curiosities, and shocking phenomena.Ripley delighted in making outrageous declarations that somehow always turned out to be true—such as that Charles Lindbergh was only the sixty-seventh man to fly across the Atlantic or that “The Star Spangled Banner” was not the national anthem. Assisted by an exotic harem of female admirers and by ex-banker Norbert Pearlroth, a devoted researcher who spoke eleven languages, Ripley simultaneously embodied the spirit of Peter Pan, the fearlessness of Marco Polo and the marketing savvy of P. T. Barnum.In a very real sense, Ripley sought to remake the world’s aesthetic. He demanded respect for those who were labeled “eccentrics” or “freaks”—whether it be E. L. Blystone, who wrote 1,615 alphabet letters on a grain of rice, or the man who could swallow his own nose.By the 1930s Ripley possessed a vast fortune, a private yacht, and a twenty-eight room mansion stocked with such “oddities” as shrunken heads and medieval torture devices, and his pioneering firsts in print, radio, and television were tapping into something deep in the American consciousness—a taste for the titillating and exotic, and a fascination with the fastest, biggest, dumbest and most weird. Today, that legacy continues and can be seen in reality TV, YouTube, America’s Funniest Home Videos, Jackass, MythBusters and a host of other pop-culture phenomena.In the end Robert L. Ripley changed everything. The supreme irony of his life, which was dedicated to exalting the strange and unusual, is that he may have been the most amazing oddity of all.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Historical', 'Adventure', 'Memoir', 'Americana']",3.64,"2,408 ratings",405 reviews,438,949,788,182,51

Haunted Ground,Erin Hart,"Die Landschaft ist idyllisch, doch die Atmosphäre mehr als vergiftet: Nachdem ein Bauer beim Torfstechen in einem irischen Moor den Kopf (und nur den Kopf!) einer jungen rothaarigen Frau entdeckt hat, von der man weder feststellen kann, wer sie ist, noch wann sie gelebt hat, ist das Dorf in Aufruhr. Schnell werden Stimmen laut, dass es sich um die drei Jahre zuvor mitsamt ihrem Kleinkind spurlos verschwundene Frau des reichsten Mannes am Ort handeln müsse, der seitdem zwar trauernde Verzweiflung zur Schau trug, von dem aber doch viele glauben, dass er seine Familie getötet habe. Dieser Verdacht ist schnell widerlegt -- und dennoch: Irgendeinen Zusammenhang zwischen den beiden Fällen scheint es zu geben.Der Archäologe Cormac Maguire ist beauftragt, die Moorleiche zu sichern; die junge und natürlich hübsche Pathologin Nora Gavin soll den Kopf anschließend untersuchen. Diese beiden Wissenschaftler bilden, vom Dorfpolizisten einmal abgesehen, das Detektivgespann dieses Romans, das sowohl dem Rätsel der im Moor gefundenen Frau als auch dem Verschwinden von Frau und Kind des Gutsherrn auf der Spur ist. Beide haben dunkle Stellen in ihrer Vergangenheit, die in diesen Fall hineinragen und das Geschehen etwas verkomplizieren; auch -- man ahnt es -- das Verhältnis zwischen den beiden nimmt einen gewissen Teil des Romans ein.Die Frau im Moor, der Erstlingsroman der jungen Amerikanerin Erin Hart, ist ein etwas unbeholfen konstruierter Krimi: Der Spannungsbogen ist oft sinnlos unterbrochen, der logische Aufbau holprig, die ganze Grundkonstellation mit dem oft recht unbegründet in der Szenerie herumstolpernden Pärchen steht in punkto Glaubwürdigkeit auf ziemlich wackligen Beinen. Wer sich einen ""Pathologie-Thriller"" à la Kathy Reichs erhofft, dem sei gleich abgeraten; von der wissenschaftlichen Präzision der Romane um die forensische Anthropologin Tempe Brennan ist dieses Buch meilenweit entfernt. Im Gegenteil, von Naturwissenschaft sollte man nicht allzu viel verstehen, das verdirbt nur den Spaß (warum genau ist die Pathologin nicht in der Lage zu bestimmen, wie viele Jahrzehnte oder Jahrhunderte die Frau mit abgetrenntem Kopf schon tot ist?).Vielleicht ist das Buch ja etwas für Irland-Fans, die Freude an stimmigen Landschaftsbeschreibungen, treffenden Figurenzeichnungen und Ausflügen in die traditionelle irische Volkskultur haben und dafür in Kauf nehmen, dass die Krimihandlung zeitweise etwas in den Hintergrund tritt und sanft wie ein irischer Bach dahinplätschert. --Christoph Nettersheim","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Ireland', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Archaeology', 'Suspense', 'Historical']",3.69,"7,204 ratings",833 reviews,"1,398","2,975","2,178",511,142

Тютюн,Dimitar Dimov,"Първо издание на оригинала.През 1946 г. е отпечатан първият откъс от романа „Тютюн“ („Литературен фронт“, № 2, 28.09.1946), озаглавен „Тютюнев склад“. 2 години по-късно излиза нов откъс — „Двубой“ („Литературен фронт“, №20, 31.01.1948), след още 1 г. — „Тютюн“ (глава от роман) в сп. „Септември“ (1949, № 7). През 1951 романът е завършен окончателно, предаден в издателство „Народна култура“ и в края на 1951 стига до читателите и до своите „злополучни критици“.„Тютюн“ се оказва не само един от най-четените романи в българската литература, но и спъни-камъкът на българската марксическа критика. Популярността му напуска романовото пространство и обсебва всичко за и около творбата. Започнал с тридневното „обсъждане“ на „Тютюн“ (8, 11 и 13.02.1952) в СБП, спорът се пренася в периодичния печат („Лит. фронт“, № 10. б.03.1952, и № 11, 13.03.1952) и кулминира в редакционната статия на в. „Работническо дело“ — „За романа `Тютюн` и неговите злополучни критици“ (16.03.1952) — спор не толкова за достойнствата на романа, колкото за границите и възможностите на догматичното литературоведско мислене.Единодушно изказаното мнение, че „Тютюн“ се нуждае от „преработване“, настойчивите подканвания, дългите обсъждания и оказаният натиск карат Димитър Димов, макар и с неохота, да се съгласи да промени романа си, като разшири описанието на работническия свят и въведе нови герои; това увеличава обема на книгата с нови 250 страници. Работата по II редакция протича съвместно с ангажирания от изд. „Народна култура“ литературен критик Яко Молхов — редактор и помощник на Димов през 1953 г., а през 1954 г. „Тютюн“ се появява в новия си вид. През 1955 излиза III издание на романа, в което Д. Димов извършва допълнигелни поправки върху текста, но и в двата случая литературната критика предпочита да се дистанцира от категорични преценки. В крайна сметка „Тютюн“ заживява в новия си вариант и едва през 1992 се появява отново в първоначалния си образ.В различните си редакции „Тютюн“ е роман и за ужасната самотност на личността в капиталистическото общество, за огромния натиск на живота върху нравствените принципи в света на капитала, и за историческата обреченост на олигархиите в България, за социалнопсихологическите причини за тяхната гибел; роман и за потиснатите от монопола на тези олигархии, за техните икономически и политически борби, и за сложния психологичен лабиринт на човешките взаимоотношения както в зловещия свят на „Никотиана“`, така и извън него. Романът е екранизиран през 1961 (режисьор Н. Корабов). До 1962 година целият роман е преведен на 10 езика (китайски, латвийски, немски, полски, румънски, руски, словашки, украински, унгарски и чешки), а части от него са преведени на английски, арабски, есперанто, испански, италиански и френски.","['Bulgarian Literature', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Bulgaria', 'Historical', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Read For School']",4.42,"7,444 ratings",164 reviews,"4,529","1,910",690,221,94

A Piece of the World,Christina Baker Kline,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the smash bestseller Orphan Train, a stunning and atmospheric novel of friendship, passion, and art, inspired by Andrew Wyeth’s mysterious and iconic painting Christina’s World.""Later he told me that he’d been afraid to show me the painting. He thought I wouldn’t like the way he portrayed me: dragging myself across the field, fingers clutching dirt, my legs twisted behind. The arid moonscape of wheatgrass and timothy. That dilapidated house in the distance, looming up like a secret that won’t stay hidden.""To Christina Olson, the entire world was her family’s remote farm in the small coastal town of Cushing, Maine. Born in the home her family had lived in for generations, and increasingly incapacitated by illness, Christina seemed destined for a small life. Instead, for more than twenty years, she was host and inspiration for the artist Andrew Wyeth, and became the subject of one of the best known American paintings of the twentieth century.As she did in her beloved smash bestseller , Christina Baker Kline interweaves fact and fiction in a powerful novel that illuminates a little-known part of America’s history. Bringing into focus the flesh-and-blood woman behind the portrait, she vividly imagines the life of a woman with a complicated relationship to her family and her past, and a special bond with one of our greatest modern artists.Told in evocative and lucid prose, is a story about the burdens and blessings of family history, and how artist and muse can come together to forge a new and timeless legacy.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Art', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family']",3.86,"65,255 ratings","5,975 reviews","19,391","25,319","14,936","3,498","2,111"

Anxiety,Danny Winter,"This book of prose and magnificent poetry is Danny’s story as he begins to notice the world around him start to shatter. Yet through all that he offers encouragement and inspiration to those millions of others who also experience anxiety and panic.There are many books on the market about anxiety, yet just a quick glance at these will demonstrate just how chintzy, patronising and condescending they really are. All these books give the impression that a few simple exercises can hold the terrors of tension, misery and dread at bay. If only it was that easy. But it’s not. Anxiety can cripple you! And there’s no easy cure, or magic words, or wrist band that is ever going to workWe start the book as Danny takes stock of those around him, and as editor of the book, before we get into more serious matters, I’ve allowed Danny 15 quick-fire poems to introduce himself, his Gypsy lifestyle as a kid and where he finds himself at the moment. He begins to notice loss, although he never phrases it quite like that. But we see loss as children fly the nest, loss of his youthful good looks and energy, a possible loss of income and finally the loss of a friend of ours, Chalkie, who was brutally murdered.Our mate, Chalkie, was a great friend to Danny, and when he was savagely murdered it sent Danny into dark places in his mind that he had trouble escaping from. Danny was very much aware that he was in danger of turning corners in the labyrinth of his mind that he may not be able to find his way out of.Danny has become a student of the human condition, and in this book he does what he does best; write poems about the world around him, and he does this with passion. Even if poems aren’t your preferred treasure, even if they don’t normally grab you, if they’re not your ‘thing,’ I’d still ask that you bear with Danny as he tells his story in his own way, for this, some would say, is what happens when someone with anxiety digs deep down into his own soul, for the book looks into the nitty-gritty of mental health awareness as Danny tells his story in a unique way, as he learns to come to terms with the barbaric and vicious murder of his best mate. Although, of course, he never does come to terms with such a cruel act. You can’t.Sometimes Danny is, to use his own words, all lopsided in his head, which is why I’ve chosen to present the book in the current format, to expose how his thinking bounces around without rhyme or reason. So he discusses anxiety and depression and suicide and then out of the blue he writes a poem, but poetry is Danny’s way of clearing his head.What can I tell you about Danny? He has a ferocious spirit and vigour. He has high moods and an instinctive ability to perceive and understand the world around him. He has a fierce sense of loyalty, he’s romantic, quixotic and starry-eyed. He brings smiles to everyone he meets, a gift I truly believe comes from a higher source.However, there’s no denying that at times he can be restless, carrying the capacity for vastly darker moods, melancholy energies and occasional bouts of madness.Writers, poets, artists, musicians and circus clowns often suffer from boisterous and raucous dispositions. And it’s true they can get into trouble at times. They wear their moods as their ships of passage, and Danny is no different. He suffers from what Lord Byron would term a ‘fine madness.’He throws out poems in a sparkle of energy. And he puts everything into the words. They just arrive on paper as though a higher being is working through him. I can’t explain this, but it’s how it happensI’ve known Danny for over 40 years, since we shared a room together at a seaside town in the South coast of England. So my opinion? He’s probably a bit of a mad genius, slowly losing his sanity, although he loves the world and everyone in it, and if this book can help just one person then Danny will sleep with a smile on his face tonight.Karl Wiggins",[],4.16,31 ratings,5 reviews,18,7,1,3,2
Fay,Larry Brown,"Larry Brown's Fay picks up at the precise moment when its 17-year-old heroine walks out of his 1991 novel Joe. And really, who could blame her? Fay's father, Wade Jones, was one of the most enduring villains in recent fiction, the kind of man who would trade a son for a car and a daughter's virginity for a few $20 bills. Reared in migrant camps, tarpaper shacks, and, most recently, an abandoned cabin, Fay herself is pretty, goodhearted, astonishingly ignorant: in other words, trouble in a too-tight dress and a pair of rotting tennis shoes. Fleeing her father's advances, she takes to the Mississippi road in a passage that, with its rough music, is pure Brown:For the first time, Brown narrates most of a novel from a woman's point of view, and while the result is every bit as gripping as his previous work, it is also more inward-looking. , for instance, reads like something carved out of a block of granite; in , Brown feels somehow closer to the story--almost tender, or as tender as a writer with such an unflinching gaze can be. As Fay hitchhikes her way down Highway 55, from the woods near Oxford to the beaches and strip bars of Biloxi, she draws both men and violence to her like a magnet. Utterly without envy or self-pity, she is a force of nature, pure and simple, and illuminates just how deadly her kind of innocence can be.","['Fiction', 'Southern', 'Southern Gothic', 'Gothic', 'Coming Of Age', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Crime', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery']",3.99,"2,897 ratings",313 reviews,985,"1,163",535,158,56
Snopes,William Faulkner,"Here, published in a single volume as Faulkner always hoped they would be, are the three novels that comprise the famous Snopes trilogy, a saga that stands as perhaps the greatest feat of Faulkner's imagination. The Hamlet, the first book of the series chronicling the advent and rise of the grasping Snopes family in mythical Yoknapatawpha County, is a work that Cleanth Brooks called ""one of the richest novels in the Faulkner canon."" It recounts how the wily, cunning Flem Snopes dominates the rural community of Frenchman's Bend - and claims the voluptuous Eula Varner as his bride. The Town, the second novel, records Flem's ruthless struggle to take over the county seat of Jefferson, Mississippi. Finally, tells of Mink Snopes, whose archaic sense of honor brings about the downfall of his cousin Flem. ""For all his concerns with the South, Faulkner was actually seeking out the nature of man,"" noted Ralph Ellison. ""Thus we must turn to him for that continuity of moral purpose which made for the greatness of our classics.""","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'American', 'Southern', 'Southern Gothic', 'Literary Fiction', 'Collections']",4.37,794 ratings,53 reviews,433,248,92,16,5
Dreams of the Ringed Vale,Robert Fanney,"Luthiel's Song is an epic fantasy novel for young adults. It is the first in a series of seven. Below is a description of the story... First Summer's Eve has come and all elves celebrate as the black moon's shadow fades from the world. It is also Luthiel's fifteenth birthday. With it come two extraordinary and dangerous surprises: a Wyrd Stone, its silvery heart a window into a world of dreams and nightmares, and a Blade Dancer, dreaded protector of the Faelands, who bears a dark message. Instead of celebration, Luthiel is given a terrible choice: if she does nothing, someone she loves deeply will die. Or to save a life, she can break the most perilous law of the Faelands, and venture alone to the Vale of Mists. If she chooses the journey, she must race Othalas -- eldest and most feared of all the werewolves -- past great back spiders who weave webs out of nightmares, through glittering mists with the power to reshape flesh, and at last into death by the teeth of dark and ancient Vyrl, who feed on the blood of elves. Either choice will bring death -- unless Luthiel can find the secret in her remarkable Stone, a secret that even the nightmares fear.","['Fantasy', 'Elves', 'Magic', 'Dragons', 'Young Adult', 'Adventure', 'Werewolves', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Fairies']",3.65,"2,974 ratings",208 reviews,976,863,544,304,287
The Sea,John Banville,"The author of The Untouchable (“contemporary fiction gets no better than this”—Patrick McGrath, The New York Times Book Review) now gives us a luminous novel about love, loss, and the unpredictable power of memory. The narrator is Max Morden, a middle-aged Irishman who, soon after his wife’s death, has gone back to the seaside town where he spent his summer holidays as a child—a retreat from the grief, anger, and numbness of his life without her. But it is also a return to the place where he met the Graces, the well-heeled vacationing family with whom he experienced the strange suddenness of both love and death for the first time.The seductive mother; the imperious father; the twins—Chloe, fiery and forthright, and Myles, silent and expressionless—in whose mysterious connection Max became profoundly entangled, each of them a part of the “barely bearable raw immediacy” of his childhood memories. Interwoven with this story are Morden’s memories of his wife, Anna—of their life together, of her death—and the moments, both significant and mundane, that make up his life now: his relationship with his grown daughter, Claire, desperate to pull him from his grief; and with the other boarders at the house where he is staying, where the past beats inside him “like a second heart.” What Max comes to understand about the past, and about its indelible effects on him, is at the center of this elegiac, vividly dramatic, beautifully written novel—among the finest we have had from this extraordinary writer","['Fiction', 'Ireland', 'Irish Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', '21st Century', 'Classics', 'Book Club']",3.54,"31,346 ratings","3,213 reviews","6,804","10,239","9,038","3,733","1,532"
The Sixth Lamentation,William Brodrick,"Larkwood Priory, Suffolk, 1995: Following his afternoon confessions, Father Anselm is stopped by an old man. What, he is asked, should a man do when the world has turned against him? Anselm’s response—claim sanctuary—is to have greater resonance than he could ever have imagined, for the man returns demanding the protection of the Church. He is Eduard Schwermann, a suspected Nazi war criminal. Meanwhile, with her life running out, Agnes Aubret unburdens a secret to her granddaughter Lucy. Fifty years earlier Agnes lived in occupied Paris and risked her life to smuggle Jewish children to safety until her group was exposed by an SS Eduard Schwermann. As Father Anselm struggles to discover the truth about Schwermann’s history and Lucy delves ever deeper into her grandmother’s past, their investigations dovetail to reveal a remarkable story, in which two seemingly unconnected lives shockingly converge. William Brodrick is a master of crisp historical re-creation, precision plotting, and morally complex characterization.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Holocaust', 'War', 'World War II', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Thriller']",3.74,"3,119 ratings",269 reviews,893,"1,106",694,261,165

Shakespeare: The Biography,Peter Ackroyd,"A TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT BEST BOOK OF THE YEARDrawing on an exceptional combination of skills as literary biographer, novelist, and chronicler of London history, Peter Ackroyd surely re-creates the world that shaped Shakespeare--and brings the playwright himself into unusually vivid focus. With characteristic narrative panache, Ackroyd immerses us in sixteenth-century Stratford and the rural landscape–the industry, the animals, even the flowers–that would appear in Shakespeare’s plays. He takes us through Shakespeare’s London neighborhood and the fertile, competitive theater world where he worked as actor and writer. He shows us Shakespeare as a businessman, and as a constant reviser of his writing. In joining these intimate details with profound intuitions about the playwright and his work, Ackroyd has produced an altogether engaging masterpiece.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'British Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Theatre', 'Drama', 'Literature', 'Historical']",4.02,"2,136 ratings",209 reviews,712,872,445,87,20

Scroll of Thoth: Simon Magus and the Great Old Ones- Twelve Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos,Richard L. Tierney,"Richard Tierney is known for his weird poetry, his heroic fantasy in the tradition of Robert E. Howard, and a critical essay in which he emphasizes the role of August Derleth in elaborating the Cthulhu Mythos. He has a sophisticated take on how to write fiction based on the H. P. Lovecraft Mythos, tapping into Lovecraft's Gnostic tendencies as well as his cosmic nihilism. The 12 tales in this collection feature Simon Magus, the famous heretic and Gnostic from the early days of Christianity. Magus meets up with Shub-Niggurath (the evil goddess), searches for the Ring of Set, and has several other dark adventures. Tierney is a fine writer with a special gift for evocative descriptions of place, and he puts more effort into characterization than is typical for modern Mythos stories. Robert Price, as editor, provides a plenitude of background materials. In his inimitably witty way, Price compares Tierney to other Lovecraftian writers and places his fiction in a rich historical, religious, and mythological context. --Fiona Webster, Horror editor","['Horror', 'Cthulhu Mythos', 'Fantasy', 'Sword and Sorcery', 'Lovecraftian', 'Fiction', 'Anthologies', 'Historical Fantasy', 'Pulp', 'Weird Fiction']",3.92,76 ratings,7 reviews,22,33,15,5,1

Bill Bryson's African Diary,Bill Bryson,"In the early fall of 2002, famed travel Writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption.","['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Kenya', 'Biography', 'History', 'Adventure', 'Travelogue']",3.47,"9,845 ratings",677 reviews,"1,752","2,851","3,855","1,094",293

Bournemouth Boys and Boscombe Girls,Danny Winter,"We’re the oddballs, weirdoes, comedians, eccentrics, head cases and hard cases, and this book is for those who ‘get it’In the lead-up to a recent reunion party, many of the old stories came out. We were seasonal workers during the late ‘70s and early ‘80s in Bournemouth. Many worked the deckchairs, some worked hotels, pubs, bars, or nightclubs, either as bar staff or bouncers.We lived off our wits and, yes, from time to time we were rogues, but we had each other’s backs and we had some laughs.This book recalls those days and tells the story of bringing a special group of people back together again after almost 40 years. And do you know what, it was as if we hadn’t skipped a beat. There were even people who’d missed each other first time around, yet all of us have a very rare and exceptional connection. It’s pure magic.Now if you’re reading the above and are thinking this was some kind of school reunion with a bunch of old codgers on Zimmer fames, playing inflatable ball games and drinking Dandelion & Burdock, mate, you’ve got it all wrong!If you’ve worked holiday towns as a seasonal worker, either in the UK or abroad, then you’ll ‘get it’ or if you’re looking to work a season in Spain or Portugal or the South coast of England, then these are the tough but crazy times you can expect. I’ve always loved wild people and wild places, always been drawn to them, and here are some of the stories.Now, for the first time ever, I think I understand what was so special about those years. Yes, at times they were tough, but we stuck with each other through thick and thin, and especially afterwards when we travelled the globe together.We’re not crazy, none of us (well, those in prison and mental asylums might be), but none of us on the ‘out’ are, but we had lively, buoyant and animated fun. We were carefree at an age when you’re supposed to be carefree. The flip side of this, I’m well aware, is that at times it may make some of us feel as if we’re outsiders, a lone wolf so to speak. People occasionally talk about us in hushed tones, whispering that we’re a bit of a loose cannon. They don’t really want to say it to our faces because every now and again we can still be a little unpredictable. But they look at us with a strange curiosity, because in comparison – although they’re often very successful at ‘fitting in’ – they lead lives that are drab, dreary and monotonous. They’re not unruly like you and me. And it’s that unruliness which has kept us young.These are the stories, some told in very funny poetic format, of those years. This book has been published for the people who shared those years to be able to keep a record. If you weren’t around on the south coast during the late 70’s and early 80’s I’d honestly give this book a miss. That’s as honest as we can get, because you won’t know the people involved, and it’s unlikely you’ll ‘get it’Some of us, you see, weren’t meant to be tamed. We weren’t meant to be pacified or subdued. We were meant to run free until we discovered others just as wild to run with. And after all we’ve been through, we’re still standing and we’re still laughing out loud. And that bothers some people.Danny and I wish to dedicate this book to all who couldn’t be there on the night. Some are living abroad, some are in prison, others in mental institutions, and some have passed on. This isn’t anything morbid. We just want to remember the laughs they gave us.KW",[],4.17,23 ratings,0 reviews,14,3,3,2,1

The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril,Paul Malmont,"The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril casts the rivalry between two of pulp fiction's most revered writers into its own saga, which bursts from the pages with blood, cruelty, fear, mystery, vengeance, courageous heroes, evil villains, dames in distress, secret identities and disguises, global schemes, hideous deaths, beautiful psychics, deadly superweapons, cliffhanging escapes, and other outrageous pulp lies that just might be completely true.Ravaged by the devastation of the Great Depression, America turned to the pulp novels for relief, for hope, for heroes.And the pulps delivered in spades.The science fiction story, the hard-boiled detective, and the superhero were all born on these cheap yellow pages, found behind blood-drenched covers dripping with sex and violence. Return now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, enter at your own risk into the dark and dank lair known as the White Horse Tavern, and meet Walter Gibson, the mind behind The Shadow, and Lester Dent, creator of Doc Savage, as they challenge one another to discover what is real and what is pulp.For Gibson, writing a new novel about The Shadow every month is a way to evade his own dark past. For his rival, Dent, creating Doc Savage is an attempt to bring the light of better days to desperate millions. In their lives and loves they are as different from one another as the heroes they've created. But now the hideous murder of the fringe pulp writer H. P. Lovecraft - victim of a mysterious death that literally makes the skin crawl - will set these two men on a collision course with each other, and face to face with a terrifying and very real evil that could have sprung from the pages of their own pulps.From the palaces and battlefields of warlord-plagued China to the seedy waterfronts of Providence, Rhode Island; from frozen seas and cursed islands to the labyrinthine tunnels and secret temples of New York's Chinatown, Dent and Gibson will find themselves in a dangerous race to stop a madman destined to create a new empire of pure evil. Together with the young pulp writer L. Ron Hubbard, a mysterious stranger, and a sexy psychic with a chicken, they will finally step out from behind their creations to take part in a heroic journey far greater than any story they have imagined. Their quest will force Gibson to look beyond the shadows and discover the true evil that lurks in the hearts of men, while Dent will learn that the nature of a true hero is not found in a fictional superman, but in the faith of the woman who challenges death itself to love him.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Pulp', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Noir', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Thriller']",3.80,893 ratings,149 reviews,220,363,231,69,10

Zeno's Conscience,Italo Svevo,"Long hailed as a seminal work of modernism in the tradition of Joyce and Kafka, and now available in a supple new English translation, Italo Svevo’s charming and splendidly idiosyncratic novel conducts readers deep into one hilariously hyperactive and endlessly self-deluding mind. The mind in question belongs to one Zeno Cosini, a neurotic Italian businessman who is writing his confessions at the behest of his psychiatrist. Here are Zeno’s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpected–and unexpectedly happy–marriage to Ada’s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer. Relating these misadventures with wry wit and irony, and a perspicacity at once unblinking and compassionate, is a miracle of psychological realism.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Psychology', 'School', 'Literary Fiction']",3.78,"25,919 ratings","1,230 reviews","7,151","9,402","6,516","2,105",745

Miss Mole,E.H. Young,"Miss Mole is set between the wars and is the story of Hannah Mole, a fortyish spinster who ekes out a living as a companion or housekeeper -- she has a sharp tongue and quirky spirit that sometimes get her into trouble. At the beginning of the novel she's returned after a long absence to the fictional town of Radstowe (which is a thinly disguised portrait of Bristol). Miss Mole is not getting along well with her current employer and after a few days in a boarding house, gets a new job via her cousin Lilla, who is from the wealthier side of the family and has some good contacts. Without revealing the family connection, Lilla recommends her for a job as a housekeeper of sorts for a rather stuffy, pompous minister named Robert Corder, whose wife has recently passed away.The household consists of Reverend Corder, a nonconformist; daughter Ethel, who's rather desperately looking for a man so she can escape the house; young Ruth, who is still in school and longing for a mother figure; and their sassy cousin Wilfred, who's attending medical school nearby. Wilfred's presence in the house is rather awkward and raises a few eyebrows, but his mother is wealthy and the Reverend can't risk offending her. A spinster housekeeper/chaperone is exactly what they need to keep the house respectable -- or so they think. Miss Mole moves in and simultaneously elevates their lives and yet turns things upside-down. She's comforting and yet slyly subversive, and Reverend Corder doesn't quite know if he should appreciate her or fear her, as Hannah is smarter than he is. Wilfred takes to her instantly, recognizing her sharp with, and Ruth grows to love her. Eventually, though, there are whispers about Miss Mole's background which much be addressed, and we learn the real reason for her long absence from her hometown.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Modern Classics', 'Humor', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Womens']",4.04,604 ratings,115 reviews,223,242,91,35,13

Erasure,Percival Everett,"Percival Everett's most recent novel, the academic satire Glyph, was hailed by the New York Times as ""both a treatise and a romp."" His new novel combines a touching story of a man coming to terms with his family heritage and a satiric indictment of race and publishing in America.Avant-garde novelist and college professor, woodworker, and fly fisherman -- Thelonious (Monk) Ellison has never allowed race to define his identity. But as both a writer and an African-American, he is offended and angered by the success of We's Lives in Da Ghetto, the exploitative debut novel of a young, middle-class black woman who once visited ""some relatives in Harlem for a couple of days."" Hailed as an authentic representation of the African-American experience, the book is a national bestseller and its author feted on the Kenya Dunston television show. Her book's success rankles all the more as Monk's own most recent novel has just notched its seventh rejection.Even as his career as a writer appears to have stalled, Monk finds himself coping with changes in his personal life. Forced to assume responsibility for a mother rapidly succumbing to Alzheimer's, Monk leaves his home in Los Angeles to return to the Washington, DC house in which he grew up. There he must come to terms with his ailing mother, his siblings, his own childhood and youth, and the legacy of his physician father, a suicide some seven years before. In need of distraction from old memories, new responsibilities, and his professional stagnation, Monk composes, in a heat of inspiration and energy, a fierce parody of the sort of exploitative, ghetto wanna-be lit represented by We's Lives in Da Ghetto.But when his agent sends this literary indictment (included here in its entirety) out to publishers, it is greeted as an authentic new voice of black America. Monk -- or his pseudonymous alter ego, Stagg R. Leigh -- is offered money, fame, success beyond anything Monk has known. And as demand begins to build for meetings with and appearances by Leigh, Monk is faced with a whole new set of problems.","['Fiction', 'Race', 'Contemporary', 'African American', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Humor', 'Literature', 'American', '21st Century']",4.22,"5,745 ratings",685 reviews,"2,461","2,318",761,164,41

The Girl Nobody Wants - A Shocking True Story of Child Abuse in Ireland,Lily O'Brien,"""It's my 40th birthday today and I'm trying to smile, but as I look in the mirror all I can see is an empty shell, someone waiting to die... You could never tell that anything was wrong with me by just looking at me, as I dress clean and I keep myself tidy, and I have a smile on my face that hides my emotions and over the years I've become an expert at hiding behind it"" This is the shocking true story of an innocent girl abused by the very people who said they would take good care of her. Lilly's family began the path to her destruction - they used and abused her - but they never ever wanted or loved her. The little girl was sexually physically and emotionally abused by many people around her who were able to hide behind the security of Ireland's Catholic Church-run institutions. She also suffered at the hands of other people around them who they called their friends. You only get one chance to live your life as a child, but Lilly was never given that chance - her childhood was taken from her before it ever begun. From the age of four, when she was first sexually abused, her life changed forever; when she walked through the institution's doors in Ireland, her life continued along the same path that has destroyed her soul. Her emotional pain is as strong today as it was the day it began and will never leave her alone. ""When I go to sleep it's in my head and when I wake up I can see it in the mirror and I am only waiting to die.""

The Smallest Part,Amy Harmon,"It was a big lie. The biggest lie she’d ever told. It reverberated through her head as she said it, ringing eerily, and the girl behind her eyes—the girl who knew the truth—screamed, and her scream echoed along with the lie.“Are you in love with Noah, Mercedes?” Cora asked. “I mean . . . I know you love him. You’ve been friends forever. We all have. But are you in love with him?”If it had been anyone else—anyone—Mercedes would have stuck out her chest, folded her skinny arms, and let her feelings be known. She would have claimed him.

To the costers, Eddie Pettit was simply a gentle soul with a near-magical gift for working with horses, and when he is killed in a violent accident, the costers are skeptical about the cause of his death. Because her father, Frankie, had been a fellow costermonger, Maisie has known these men since childhood and remembers Eddie fondly, so she is determined to help, but it soon becomes clear that powerful political and financial forces are equally determined to prevent her from learning too much about Eddie’s death.Maisie’s search for answers begins in the working-class streets of Lambeth—where Eddie lived, and where she grew up—but quickly leads her to a callous press baron, a “has been” politician named Winston Churchill lingering in the hinterlands of power and, most surprisingly, to Douglas Partridge, the husband of her dearest friend, Priscilla.

Rabbit Angstrom: The Four Novels,John Updike,"When we first met him in Rabbit, Run (1960), the book that established John Updike as a major novelist, Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom is playing basketball with some boys in an alley in Pennsylvania during the tail end of the Eisenhower era, reliving for a moment his past as a star high school athlete. Athleticism of a different sort is on display throughout these four magnificent novels—the athleticism of an imagination possessed of the ability to lay bare, with a seemingly effortless animal grace, the enchantments and disenchantments of life.Updike revisited his hero toward the end of each of the following decades in the second half of this American century; and in each of the subsequent novels, as Rabbit, his wife, Janice, his son, Nelson, and the people around them grow, these characters take on the lineaments of our common existence. In prose that is one of the glories of contemporary literature, Updike has chronicled the frustrations and ambiguous triumphs, the longuers, the loves and frenzies, the betrayals and reconciliations of our era. He has given us our representative American story.This Rabbit Angstrom volume is composed of the following novels: Rabbit, Run; Rabbit Redux; Rabbit is Rich; and Rabbit at Rest.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Collections', 'Modern Classics']",4.25,"1,657 ratings",155 reviews,846,516,195,66,34

Genesis,Bernard Beckett,"Anax thinks she knows history. Her grueling all-day Examination has just begun, and if she passes, she’ll be admitted into the Academy—the elite governing institution of her utopian society.

As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues—a bee, a key, and a sword—that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'LGBT', 'Audiobook', 'Books About Books', 'Queer', 'Magic']",3.86,"195,065 ratings","36,656 reviews","71,872","55,974","41,294","19,382","6,543"

Locked Rooms,Laurie R. King,"Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are back in Laurie R. King's highly acclaimed New York Times bestselling mystery series. And this time the first couple of detection pair up to unlock the buried memory of a shocking crime with the power to kill again-lost somewhere in Russell's own past.After departing Bombay by ship, Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are en route to the bustling modern city of San Francisco. There, Mary will settle some legal affairs surrounding the inheritance of her family's old estate. But the closer they get to port, the more Mary finds herself prey to troubling dreams and irrational behavior-a point not lost on Holmes, much to Russell's annoyance.In 1906, when Mary was six, San Francisco was devastated by an earthquake and a raging fire that reduced the city to rubble. For years, Mary has denied any memory of the catastrophe that for days turned the fabled streets into hell on earth. But Holmes suspects that some hidden trauma connected with the ""unforgettable"" catastrophe may be the real culprit responsible for Mary's memory lapse. And no sooner do they begin to familiarize themselves with the particulars of the Russell estate than it becomes apparent that whatever unpleasantness Mary has forgotten, it hasn't forgotten her. Why does her father's will forbid access to the house except in the presence of immediate family? Why did someone break in, then take nothing of any value? And why is Russell herself targeted for assassination?The more questions they ask of Mary's past, the more people from that past turn out to have died violent, unexplained deaths. Now, with the aid of a hard-boiled young detective and crime writer named Hammett, Russell and Holmes find themselves embroiled in a mystery that leads them through the winding streets of Chinatown to the unspoken secrets of a parent's marriage and the tragic car ""accident"" that a fourteen-year-old Mary alone survived-an accident that may not have been an accident at all. What Russell is about to discover is that even a forgotten past never dies...and it can kill again.","['Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Mystery', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Detective', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Adult']",4.27,"15,125 ratings",979 reviews,"6,801","6,026","2,001",233,64

Life: A User's Manual,Georges Perec,"Life is an unclassified masterpiece, a sprawling compendium as encyclopedic as Dante’s Commedia and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and, in its break with tradition, as inspiring as Joyce’s Ulysses. Structured around a single moment in time — 8:00 p.m. on June 23, 1975 — Perec’s spellbinding puzzle begins in an apartment block in the XVIIth arrondissement of Paris where, chapter by chapter, room by room, like an onion being peeled, an extraordinary rich cast of characters is revealed in a series of tales that are bizarre, unlikely, moving, funny, or (sometimes) quite ordinary. From the confessions of a racing cyclist to the plans of an avenging murderer, from a young ethnographer obsessed with a Sumatran tribe to the death of a trapeze artist, from the fears of an ex-croupier to the dreams of a sex-change pop star to an eccentric English millionaire who has devised the ultimate pastime, Life is a manual of human irony, portraying the mixed marriages of fortunes, passions and despairs, betrayals and bereavements, of hundreds of lives in Paris and around the world.But the novel is more than just an extraordinary range of fictions; it is a closely observed account of life and experience. The apartment block’s one hundred rooms are arranged in a magic square, and the book as a whole is peppered with a staggering range of literary puzzles and allusions, acrostics, problems of chess and logic, crosswords, and mathematical formula. All are there for the reader to solve in the best tradition of the detective novel.","['Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Philosophy', 'Contemporary']",4.19,"8,808 ratings",864 reviews,"4,406","2,508","1,264",436,194

Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland,Patrick Radden Keefe,"In December 1972, Jean McConville, a thirty-eight-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders.Patrick Radden Keefe writes an intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussions.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Ireland', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Irish Literature', 'Mystery']",4.45,"98,387 ratings","10,906 reviews","56,439","32,280","7,947","1,258",463

The Water Thief,Ben Pastor,"In 304 c.e. Aelius Spartianus, officer and historian at the court of Diocletian in Dalmatia, is writing the biographies of past Roman rulers, including Hadrian, who has been dead for nearly 175 years. Aelius's particular charge is to investigate the unsolved mystery of the drowning death in the Nile of Hadrian's favorite, young Antinous.Soon his duty turns twofold: the hunt for Antinous's grave, supposed to conceal proof of a conspiracy against Rome, and the murder of a wealthy army supplier and his servant. The mystery thickens as deaths multiply; scholarly work turns into a race against time and into a confrontation with risk, lies, and half-truths at the hands of priests, authorities, and former colleagues. While the trials against Christians (later known as the Great Persecution) inflame Egypt, Aelius gathers clues in odd places until his road leads inescapably to Rome.Joined in his search by a blind retired soldier who is well experienced in counterespionage, Aelius scavenges for evidence in a world capital in decline. From Rome his breathless trail takes him to Hadrian's country estate, which is now acres and acres of monumental ruins in the wilderness. In the haunted stillness of roofless halls and overgrown gardens, Aelius deciphers the great plan of the villa, an astronomical chart confirming how the danger against Rome is clear and imminent. But who is behind it all? How deadly close is danger? In order to save the state and himself, Aelius must solve not only the puzzle of Antinous's drowning, but also the murders that have marred his path.Internationally renowned and critically acclaimed author Ben Pastor brings her thematic skill to bear in this new historical mystery.

The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man,James Weldon Johnson,"James Weldon Johnson's emotionally gripping novel is a landmark in black literary history and, more than eighty years after its original anonymous publication, a classic of American fiction.The first fictional memoir ever written by a black person, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man influenced a generation of writers during the Harlem Renaissance and served as eloquent inspiration for Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, and Richard Wright. In the 1920s and since, it has also given white readers a startling new perspective on their own culture, revealing to many the double standard of racial identity imposed on black Americans.Narrated by a mulatto man whose light skin allows him to ""pass"" for white, the novel describes a pilgrimage through America's color lines at the turn of the century--from a black college in Jacksonville to an elite New York nightclub, from the rural South to the white suburbs of the Northeast.This is a powerful, unsentimental examination of race in America, a hymn to the anguish of forging an identity in a nation obsessed with color.

Watchers of Time,Charles Todd,"The year is 1919, and Ian Rutledge is a fragile yet courageous former soldier searching for his place in a postwar world. Now a Scotland Yard investigator, Rutledge is called upon to probe a small-town murder — and discovers that it may be connected to one of the greatest disasters of all time....In Osterley, a marshy Norfolk backwater, a man lies dying on a rainy autumn night. While natural causes will surely claim Herbert Baker’s life in a matter of hours, his last request baffles his family and friends.Baker, a devout Anglican, inexplicably demands to see the town’s Catholic priest for a last confession. The old man dies without knowing that the very priest who gave him comfort will follow him to the grave just a few weeks later — the victim of an appalling murder.The local police are convinced the evidence points to an interrupted robbery, and have named a suspect, Matthew Walsh. But the dead priest’s bishop insists that Scotland Yard oversee the investigation. A simple task for Rutledge, a man not yet well enough to return to full duty.The Inspector draws on years of experience and a war-honed intuition as he finds himself uncovering secrets that the local authorities would prefer not to see explored. Surely, they reason, it is better to charge an outsider — Matthew Walsh — with murder than to learn that someone in this tightly knit community would commit such a horrendous crime. And yet there are those, Rutledge soon discovers, who held grudges against the priest that had little to do with God or the Church.No one in Osterley is aware that Rutledge hears voices — or, rather, one haunting voice: that of a soldier he was forced to execute during the War. It is with the voice of Hamish MacLeod, by turns second-guessing and taunting him, that Rutledge begins a journey toward the devastating truth that will unlock the secrets of Osterley and pare away its layers of deception.And in piecing together a different story, Rutledge encounters a chain of events that stretches from these brooding marshes to one of the greatest sea disasters in history — the sinking of the . Who is the mysterious woman who may have boarded that ship ... and who is the secretive woman who survived it? Rutledge comes to believe that he alone can stop a killer from striking again.Deftly capturing the anguish of a man haunted by his tragic past, delves beneath a cast of unforgettable characters to examine a mystery even greater than murder: the mystery of what is right and what is wrong after the world has committed the sin of war.","['Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical Mystery', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Detective', 'World War I']",3.99,"6,643 ratings",494 reviews,"1,940","3,021","1,403",204,75

The Maids / Deathwatch,Jean Genet,"The two plays featured in this volume represent Genet's first attempts to analyze the mores of a bourgeois society he had previously been content simply to vilify. In The Maids, two domestic workers, deeply resentful of their inferior social position, try to revenge themselves against society by destroying their employer. When their attempt to betray their mistress's lover to the police fails and they are in danger of being found out, they dream of murdering Madame, little aware of the true power behind their darkest fantasy.In the second play Deathwatch, two convicts try to impress a third, who is on the verge of achieving legendary status in criminal circles. But neither realizes the lengths to which they will go to gain respect or that, in the end, nothing they can do--including murder--will get them what they are searching for.","['Plays', 'Drama', 'Theatre', 'France', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Queer', 'Literature', '20th Century']",3.93,"2,042 ratings",57 reviews,653,775,464,110,40

Her Smoke Rose Up Forever,James Tiptree Jr.,"These 18 darkly complex short stories and novellas touch upon human nature and perception, metaphysics and epistemology, and gender and sexuality, foreshadowing a world in which biological tendencies bring about the downfall of humankind. Revisions from the author's notes are included, allowing a deeper view into her world and a better understanding of her work. The Nebula Award–winning short story Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death, the Hugo Award–winning novella The Girl Who Was Plugged In, and the Hugo and Nebula Award–winning novella Houston, Houston, Do You Read? are included.The stories of Alice Sheldon, who wrote as James Tiptree Jr. ( Up the Walls of the World ) until her death in 1987, have been heretofore available mostly in out-of-print collections. Thus the 18 accomplished stories here will be welcomed by new readers and old fans. ''The Screwfly Solution'' describes a chilling, elegant answer to the population problem. In ''Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death,'' the title tells the tale--species survival insured by imprinted drives--but the story's force is in its exquisite, lyrical prose and its suggestion that personal uniqueness is possible even within biological imperatives. ''The Girl Who Was Plugged In'' is a future boy-meets-girl story with a twist unexpected by the players. ''The Women Men Don't See '' displays Tiptree's keen insight and ability to depict singularity within the ordinary. In Hugo and Nebula award-winning ''Houston, Houston, Do You Read?'' astronauts flying by the sun slip forward 500 years and encounter a culture that successfully questions gender roles in ours.ContentsIntroduction by Michael SwanwickThe Last Flight of Doctor Ain (1969)The Screwfly Solution (1977)And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill’s Side (1972)The Girl Who Was Plugged In (1973)The Man Who Walked Home (1972)And I Have Come Upon This Place by Lost Ways (1972)The Women Men Don’t See (1973)Your Faces, O My Sisters!

I Should Be Extremely Happy in Your Company: A Novel of Lewis and Clark,Brian Hall,"""Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's expedition to the Pacific Ocean and back in the early nineteenth century is the most famous journey in American history. But its very fame has obscured its oddness. Its public image of discovery and triumphant return has veiled its private stories of longing and loss, of self-discovery and mutual ignorances, of good luck and mischance and fortunate misunderstanding.""""Rather than concentrate exclusively on the expedition, Brian Hall has chosen to focus on emblematic moments through the whole range of the lives of its participants. Ever present as a backdrop is the violent collision of white and Native American cultures, and the broader tragedy of the inability of any human being to truly understand what lies in the heart of another.""Hall has written the novel in four competing voices. The primary one is that of Lewis, the troubled and mercurial figure who found that it was impossible to enter paradise without having it crumble around him. Hall brings this enigmatic character to life as no historian ever has. A second voice is that of the Shoshone girl-captive Sacagawea, interpretor on the expedition, whose short life of disruption and displacement mirrored the times in which she lived. Other perspectives are provided by William Clark and by Toussaint Charbonneau, the French fur trader who took Sacagawea as his wife.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Westerns', 'American History', 'American', '19th Century', 'Adventure', 'LGBT']",3.36,443 ratings,93 reviews,83,129,134,58,39

Blacklist,Sara Paretsky,"From one of the most distinguished writers in American crime fiction - her most brilliant and daring novel yet.This is a story of secrets and betrayals that stretch across four generations-secrets political, social, sexual, all of them with the power to kill. Eager for something physical to do in the spirit-exhausting wake of 9/11, V.I. accepts a request from an old client to check up on an empty family mansion; sub-sequently surprises an intruder in the dark; and, giving chase, topples into a pond. Grasping for something to hold on to, her fingers close around a lifeless human hand.It is the body of a reporter who had been investigating events of forty-five years earlier, during the McCarthy era, and V.I.'s discovery quickly sucks her into the history of two great Chicago families-their fortunes intertwined by blood, sex, money, and the scandals that may or may not have resulted in murder all these years later. At the same time, she inadvertently becomes involved in the story of a missing Egyptian boy whose possible terrorist connections make him very much sought after by the government. As the two cases drive her forward-and then shockingly tumble together-she finds that wealth and privilege, too, bear a terrible price; and the past has no monopoly on patriotic scoundrels. Before everything is over, at least two more people will lie dead . . . and V.I. might even be one of them.A novel as passionate, complex, and powerfully entertaining as its acclaimed heroine, Blacklist is a stunning achievement.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Suspense', 'Noir', 'Murder Mystery']",3.85,"4,666 ratings",331 reviews,"1,151","2,024","1,207",230,54

Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig,Jonathan Eig,"The definitive account of the life and tragic death of baseball legend Lou Gehrig.Lou Gehrig was a baseball legend—the Iron Horse, the stoic New York Yankee who was the greatest first baseman in history, a man whose consecutive-games streak was ended by a horrible disease that now bears his name. But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig’s life was more complicated—and, perhaps, even more heroic—than anyone really knew.Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred pages of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, Luckiest Man gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig’s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig’s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous “luckiest man” speech.Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig’s Luckiest Man shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we’ve never seen him before.","['Baseball', 'Sports', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Science']",4.24,"5,372 ratings",329 reviews,"2,567","1,830",751,150,74

Hangover Square: A Story of Darkest Earl's Court,Patrick Hamilton,"Hamilton (1904–1962) captures the edgy, obsessive and eventually murderous mindset of a romantically frustrated British man in this WWII-era novel published in the U.S. as a separate volume for the first time. As the story opens, 34-year-old George Harvey Bone—a heavyset, good-hearted failure—is obsessed with his ongoing effort to either woo or, frighteningly, kill the lovely Netta Longdon, a callous, smalltime London actress whose charms seem limited to her physical beauty. Longdon shows little interest in Bone's advances, but she always seems ready to take advantage of Bone's generosity and to stab him in the back by, say, sleeping with one of his lowlife cohorts. As the book progresses and Bone gets more and more intense, it becomes clear that the virtual fugue state that he periodically enters is undiagnosed schizophrenia—the twist is that everyone else's behavior is so beastly that Bone's plottings feel pretty much deserved. Hamilton is less successful introducing political material on Hitler's rise to power as the forces of war begin to overwhelm Britain, but the subtle power of the free indirect prose he uses to render Bone's deteriorating mind makes this an impressive character study and an oblique (and bleak) look at beleaguered prewar London.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Mystery', 'British Literature', 'Crime', 'Noir', 'Novels', 'Modern Classics', '20th Century', 'Literature']",4.13,"5,075 ratings",496 reviews,"2,004","2,011",819,200,41

Why do only two lines survive of his play Medea, reputedly his most passionate, most accomplished work? Between the known details of Ovidâ€™s life and these enigmas, Jane Alison has created a haunting drama ofpsychological manipulation, and an ingenious meditation on love, art and immortality.

The Last Werewolf,Glen Duncan,"Here is a powerful, definitive new version of the werewolf legend—mesmerising and incredibly sexy. In Jake, Glen Duncan has given us a werewolf for the twenty-first century—a man whose deeds can only be described as monstrous but who is in some magical way deeply human.Meet Jake. A bit on the elderly side (he turns 201 in March), but otherwise in the pink of health. The nonstop sex and exercise he's still getting probably contribute to that, as does his diet: unusual amounts of flesh and blood (at least some from friends and relatives). Jake, of course, is a werewolf, and with the death of his colleague he has now become the only one of his kind. This depresses Jake to the point that he's been contemplating suicide. Yet there are powerful forces who for very different reasons want - and have the power - to keep Jake alive.Here is a powerful new version of the werewolf legend - mesmerizing and undeniably sexy, and with moments of violence so elegantly wrought they dazzle rather than repel. But perhaps its most remarkable achievement is to make the reader feel sympathy for a man who can only be described as a monster - and in doing so, remind us what it means to be human.One of the most original, audacious, and terrifying novels in years.","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Werewolves', 'Paranormal', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Supernatural', 'Adult', 'Vampires', 'Audiobook']",3.46,"16,182 ratings","2,694 reviews","2,925","5,477","4,795","2,018",967

Briec the Mighty knew the moment he laid eyes on Talaith that she would be his, but he’d counted on tongue-lashings of an altogether different sort. It’s embarrassing, really, that it isn’t this outspoken female’s magicks that have the realm’s greatest dragon in her thrall.

Sidney discovers that being a detective, like being a clergyman, means that you are never off duty, but he nonetheless manages to find time for a keen interest in cricket, warm beer, and hot jazz - as well as a curious fondness for a German widow three years his junior.With a whiff of Agatha Christie and a touch of G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown, introduces a wonderful new hero into the world of detective fiction.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Short Stories', 'British Literature', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Historical Mystery']",3.68,"9,036 ratings","1,352 reviews",,"3,705","2,946",603,126

For his wife, Linda, who had held the family together for years, who had prayed nightly for Donny’s recovery, it was a miracle. For his doctors and nurses, it was a medical mystery. For his sonsÑincluding his youngest, with whom he had never before had a conversationÑit was a blessing. After his remarkable day, Donny Herbert fell into a deep sleep and never experienced a comparable moment of clarity. He died, in February 2006, from pneumonia.Written by Linda’s cousin, The Day Donny Herbert Woke Up makes the reader Was it an experimental drug cocktail or an act of God that brought Donny back? Linda believes that each contributed to the miraculous day when he woke, but more than anything, she credits Donny himself-a man with the strength to will himself back into his family’s lives, if only to remind them one last time of how very much he loved them. This is as much Linda’s storyÑone of perseverance and faith-as it is of a remarkable husband, father, and firefighter.",[],3.63,227 ratings,39 reviews,50,70,83,22,2

He'd heard that the locals constructed jerry-rigged hoops out of any material they could get their hands on-car hoods, driftwood, twisted rebar-and built courts everywhere, from cluttered street corners to the slopes of volcanoes and in the thick of jungles.Allured by the idea of an island nation full of people who love the game as irrationally as he does, American journalist Rafe Bartholomew arrived in Manila to unlock the riddle of basketball's grip on the Philippines.

Sweating his way through hard-fought games of 3-on-3, played with homemade hoops for 50-cent wagers, Bartholomew uses a mix of journalistic knowhow and the hard- court ethics he learned from his dad to get in the paint and behind the scenes of Filipinos' against-all-odds devotion to the sport.",[],4.29,808 ratings,73 reviews,420,242,119,16,11

Path of Destruction,Drew Karpyshyn,"Thousands of years before the rise of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, the Old Republic was rife with the evil Sith, who were a constant thorn in the side of the Jedi. But greed and hunger for power were eating away at the Sith Order, destroying it from within. In the midst of this rose a new Sith, Darth Bane, who recognized that the Sith Order would fall if nothing was done. Thus it was he who, learning to cultivate patience and cunning, hid from the strife until it was over, and then rose to become the most powerful Sith Lord ever.This is the story of the transformation of Des, a young miner, into the legendary Sith Lord Darth Bane. Des - like many of the disenfranchised who live on the Outer Rim - is disillusioned with the stagnancy of the Old Republic. When the Sith unite to bring the Republic down, Des is one of many to join their cause. His heroism and skill in battle - along with his remarkable connection to the Force - draw the notice of the Sith Masters, and Des eventually finds himself studying at the Sith Academy on Korriban. He takes the name of Bane and, amidst the deception and back-stabbing of the other students, he learns to unlock his latent dark-side talents. As his power grows, Bane realizes the Sith have lost their way. Under the leadership of Lord Kaan and his Brotherhood of Darkness, the Sith have turned their back on the true nature of the dark side. Through manipulation, cunning and strength, Bane destroys Kaan's Brotherhood and wipes out all the other Sith so he can found a new Order based on the rule of two: one Master, one apprentice.","['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Adventure']",4.33,"29,979 ratings","1,699 reviews","15,350","10,056","3,759",675,139

The Gamble of the Godless,Dave Maine,"Avin del Bors has a problem. His brother Drew has run off to fight in a war against the wolves, even though the wolves weren’t responsible for the vicious attack against the humans on the Free Plains. Avin’s companions—the warrior Ax, one-armed sorcerer Jocen, plucky owl Ulkia, drug-addled cheetah Summon the Wind and raccoon stand-up comic Onesso—all have their own reasons for accompanying him through the animal territories across the Bladebone Mountains. Their travels will take them from the highly regimented wolf cities, to the richesse and luxury of the Equine Commonwealth, all the way to the vertiginous tunnels of the serpents’ underground Net and across the waters of the Autonomous Dolphin Collective—to whatever unknown awaits them.What neither Avin nor his companions yet understand is that the real force behind the Free Plains attack is neither canine nor feline, nor yet crocodile, insect, raptor, bear or shark. Far to the east, in the scorched wasteland known as The Barrens, lives the ragged clan that calls itself The Godless. There, Avin will confront his brother, his companions and himself, and discover two truths: one that changes everything he understands about himself, and another that threatens the balance of the entire world.Dave Maine aka David Maine is the author of The Preservationist (2004), Fallen (2005), The Book of Samson (2006) and Monster, 1959 (2008) and his work has been translated into more than 8 languages.

"Horseman, Pass By",Larry McMurtry,"From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lonesome Dove comes the novel that became the basis for the film Hud , starring Paul Newman. In classic Western style Larry McMurtry illustrates the timeless conflict between the modernity and the Old West through the eyes of Texas cattlemen.Horseman, Pass By tells the story of Homer Bannon, an old-time cattleman who epitomizes the frontier values of honesty and decency, and Hud, his unscrupulous stepson. Caught in the middle is the narrator, Homer's young grandson Lonnie, who is as much drawn to his grandfather’s strength of character as he is to Hud's hedonism and materialism.When first published in 1961, Horseman, Pass By caused a sensation in Texas literary circles for its stark, realistic portrayal of the struggles of a changing West in the years following World War II. Never before had a writer managed to encapsulate its environment with such unsentimental realism.

472 Days Captive of the Abu Sayyaf: The Survival of Australian Warren Rodwell,Bob East,"In December 2011, the Australian world traveller, ex-member of the Australian Regular Army and university teacher Warren Richard Rodwell was kidnapped for ransom in the Mindanao region of the southern Philippines by a group of criminals claiming to be members of the notorious terrorist/insurgent organisation the Abu Sayyaf Group. This particular group had loose ties with other insurgent groups that were indulging in similar criminal activity in the greater Sulu Archipelago area including the Zamboanga peninsular - where Rodwell was abducted. Rodwell was kept prisoner for a total of 472 days making him the longest held Australian captive outside of official Prisoners-of-War (POWs). During his 472 days of captivity he was moved between various jungle hideouts in the Islands of Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, eventually being freed by his captors only a few kilometres from where he was originally kidnapped. His tale of survival is made all the more remarkable considering he endured an untreated gunshot wound and an almost starvation diet - losing over one third of his body weight - and was forced to walk and climb in oppressive heat and under constant threat of being beheaded. When he was finally released in March 2013 he was emaciated, physically and emotionally at the lowest point in his life, and totally bewildered. During his period of obligatory debriefing by both Philippine and Australian authorities, an amazing tale of survival unfolded. Rodwell's determination to overcome all obstacles in his path to eventual freedom is the quintessence of all that is dear in life - life itself.",[],3.00,1 rating,0 reviews,0,0,1,0,0

The Doll,Bolesław Prus,"Bołeslaw Prus is often compared to Chekhov, and Prus’s masterpiece might be described as an intimate epic, a beautifully detailed, utterly absorbing exploration of life in late-nineteenth-century Warsaw, which is also a prophetic reckoning with some of the social forces—imperialism, nationalism, anti-Semitism among them—that would soon convulse Europe as never before. But The Doll is above all a brilliant novel of character, dramatizing conflicting ideas through the various convictions, ambitions, confusions, and frustrations of an extensive and varied cast. At the center of the novel are three men from three different generations. Prus’s fatally flawed hero is Wokulski, a successful businessman who yearns for recognition from Poland’s decadent aristocracy and falls desperately in love with the highborn, glacially beautiful Izabela.Wokulski’s story is intertwined with those of the incorrigibly romantic old clerk Rzecki, nostalgic for the revolutions of 1848, and of the bright young scientist Ochocki, who dreams of a future full of flying machines and other marvels, making for a book of great scope and richness that is, as Stanisław Barańczak writes in his introduction, at once “an old-fashioned yet still fascinating love story . . . , a still topical diagnosis of society’s ills, and a forceful yet subtle portrayal of a tragically doomed man","['Classics', 'Polish Literature', 'School', 'Fiction', 'Poland', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', '19th Century', 'Romance', 'Read For School']",3.80,"19,330 ratings","1,600 reviews","5,677","7,122","4,270","1,558",703

"The Devil's Tickets: A Night of Bridge, a Fatal Hand, and a New American Age",Gary M. Pomerantz,"Kansas City, 1929: Myrtle and Jack Bennett sit down with another couple for an evening of bridge. As the game intensifies, Myrtle complains that Jack is a “bum bridge player.” For such insubordination, he slaps her hard in front of their stunned guests and announces he is leaving. Moments later, sobbing, with a Colt .32 pistolin hand, Myrtle fires four shots, killing her husband.The Roaring 1920s inspired nationwide fads–flagpole sitting, marathon dancing, swimming-pool endurance floating. But of all the mad games that cheered Americans between the wars, the least likely was contract bridge. As the Barnum of the bridge craze, Ely Culbertson, a tuxedoed boulevardier with a Russian accent, used mystique, brilliance, and a certain madness to transform bridge from a social pastime into a cultural movement that made him rich and famous. In writings, in lectures, and on the radio, he used the Bennett killing to dramatize bridge as the battle of the sexes. Indeed, Myrtle Bennett’s murder trial became a sensation because it brought a beautiful housewife–and hints of her husband’s infidelity–from the bridge table into the national spotlight. James A. Reed, Myrtle’s high-powered lawyer and onetime Democratic presidential candidate, delivered soaring, tear-filled courtroom orations. As Reed waxed on about the sanctity of womanhood, he was secretly conducting an extramarital romance with a feminist trailblazer who lived next door.To the public, bridge symbolized tossing aside the ideals of the Puritans–who referred derisively to playing cards as “the Devil’s tickets”–and embracing the modern age. Ina time when such fearless women as Amelia Earhart, Dorothy Parker, and Marlene Dietrich were exalted for their boldness, Culbertson positioned his game as a challenge to all housebound women. At the bridge table, he insisted, a woman could be her husband’s equal, and more. In the gathering darkness of the Depression, Culbertson leveraged his own ballyhoo and naughty innuendo for all it was worth, maneuvering himself and his brilliant wife, Jo, his favorite bridge partner, into a media spectacle dubbed the Bridge Battle of the Century. Through these larger-than-life characters and the timeless partnership game they played, The Devil’s Tickets captures a uniquely colorful age and a tension in marriage that is eternal.","['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Biography Memoir']",3.32,419 ratings,93 reviews,38,134,185,47,15

They wouldn't have fit in well with the original Flat-Out Love, but given that this is a fan-driven companion piece, I think they work.

Serial Uncut: Extended Edition,Jack Kilborn,"This is the first in the terrifying trilogy of novellas including KILLERS and BIRDS OF PREY by Crouch and Kilborn.The original version of SERIAL, still available as a free ebook, was a 7500 word horror short story done as an experiment.Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don’t go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don’t pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be certifiably crazy.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2?When Blake Crouch (DESERT PLACES, ABANDON) and Jack Kilborn (AFRAID, SHAKEN), face-off, the result is SERIAL, a terrifying tale of hitchhiking gone terribly wrong. Like a deeply twisted version of an “After School Special,” SERIAL is the single most persuasive public service announcement on the hazards of free car rides.Beyond a thrilling piece of horrifying suspense, SERIAL is also a groundbreaking experiment in literary collaboration. Kilborn wrote the first part. Crouch wrote the second. And they wrote the third together over email in 100-word exchanges, not aware of each other’s opening section. All bets were off, and may the best psychopath win.F. Paul Wilson says, “SERIAL reads just like a Crouch or Kilborn novel: Full speed ahead, no flinching, no blinking, no brakes.”In a year, SERIAL has been downloaded over 500,000 times, and has received over a hundred negative reviews, with many people claiming it is the most depraved, awful thing they've ever read.SERIAL UNCUT is newly expanded, now more than 36,000 words. Along with the reinsertion of additional material cut from the original version, it also has a vastly expanded beginning and ending, including an extended section that originally appeared in the novellas TRUCK STOP by J.A. Konrath and BAD GIRL by Blake Crouch. This edition has been specially formatted for Kindle, with an interactive table of contents. It also features a preview of the sequel, KILLERS.If you can handle horrific thrills, proceed at your own risk.But if you suffer from anxiety attacks, nervous disorders, insomnia, nightmares or night terrors, heart palpitations, stomach problems, or are of an overly sensitive nature, you should read something else instead.The authors are in no way responsible for any lost sleep, missed work, failed relationships, or difficulty in coping with life after you have read SERIAL UNCUT. They will not pay for any therapy you may require as a result of reading SERIAL UNCUT. They will not cradle you in their arms, rock you back and forth, and speak in soothing tones while you unsuccessfully try to forget SERIAL UNCUT.You have been warned...NOTE: The three novellas in this series are: Serial Uncut, Killers, and Birds of Prey.These novellas are also available in a variety of compilations.Killers Uncut = Killers + Birds of Prey.Serial Killers Uncut = Serial Uncut + Killers + Break You + Birds of Prey.","['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Short Stories', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Dark', 'True Crime']",3.97,"1,272 ratings",94 reviews,490,389,287,71,35

So was the robber, by a cop, supposedly for resisting arrest. From the exclusive haunts of Houston's super-rich to the city's seamy underworld of prostitutes, pimps, and punks, author and investigative journalist Thomas Thompson tracks down all the leads and clues.

Lotte's thoughts, as she anticipates meeting Goethe again after forty years, and her conversations with those in Weimar who knew the great man, allow Mann to assess Goethe's genius from many points of view.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Germany', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Roman', 'Novels']",3.59,"1,237 ratings",101 reviews,,395,414,120,40

Then there are those who question the Concern: the bandit queen Mrs. Mulverhill, roaming the worlds recruiting rebels to her side; and Patient 8262, under sedation and feigning madness in a forgotten hospital ward, in hiding from a dirty past.There is a world that needs help; but whether it needs the Concern is a different matter.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space', 'International', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Technology']",3.86,"10,668 ratings",713 reviews,"2,954","4,352","2,524",641,197

Wicked City,Ace Atkins,"From ""one of crime fiction's most interesting and passionate voices"" (Laura Lippman) comes a new ""noir crime classic"" (""Mystery Ink"") about one of the most notorious towns in American history.Reviewing ""White Shadow,"" the Associated Press wrote, ""It is as gritty as James Ellroy's ""L.A. Confidential."" And yet, the prose is as lyrical as James Lee Burke's ""Crusader's Cross."" With ""White Shadow,"" Atkins has found his true voice."" And with Wicked City, it is even truer.In 1955, ""Look"" magazine called Phenix City, Alabama, ""The Wickedest City in America,"" but even that may have been an understatement. It was a stew of organized crime and corruption, run by a machine that dealt with complaints forcefully and with dispatch. No one dared cross them-no one even tried. And then the machine killed the wrong man.When crime-fighting attorney Albert Patterson is gunned down in a Phenix City alley in the spring of 1954, the entire town seems to pause just for a moment- and when it starts up again, there is something different about it. A small group of men meet and decide that they have had enough, but what that means and where it will take them is something they could not have foreseen. Over the course of the next several months, lives will change, people will die, and unexpected heroes will emerge-like ""a Randolph Scott western,"" one of them remarks, ""played out not with horses and Winchesters but with Chevys and .38s and switchblades.""Peopled by an extraordinary cast of characters, both real and fictional, ""Wicked City"" is a novel of uncommon intensity-rich with atmosphere and filled with sensuality and surprise.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Southern', 'True Crime', 'Noir']",3.68,637 ratings,77 reviews,149,232,183,46,27

His daughter had been the focus of Lord Henry's roving eye in the weeks before his death and he was not a man to take no for an answer. But the culprit could just as easily be Sir William, the dead man's younger brother. It is no secret that Sir William covets the Fitzalan estate - but would he kill to inherit it?

Wake in Fright,Kenneth Cook,"Filmed as The OutbackWake In Fright was first published in 1961 and the film version, The Outback, starring Donald Pleasance was released in 1971.

He finds himself stuck overnight in Bundanyabba, a rough outback mining town. An ill-advised and drink-fuelled visit to a gambling den leaves Grant broke and he realizes he has no way of escaping. He descends into a cycle of hangovers, fumbling sexual encounters, and increasing self-loathing as he becomes more and more immersed in the grotesque and surreal nightmare that his life has become.","['Fiction', 'Australia', 'Horror', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Dark', '20th Century', 'Drama']",3.98,"2,603 ratings",366 reviews,778,"1,186",488,107,44

She is the first non-aristocratic woman to enter the longest-running, almost hermetically sealed, and mysterious monarchy in the world.

Thirty years later, now Empress herself, she plays a crucial role in persuading another young woman's rising star in the foreign ministry to accept the marriage proposal of her son, the Crown Prince. The consequences are tragic and dramatic.Told in the voice of Haruko, meticulously researched and superbly imagined, is the mesmerizing, moving, and surprising story of a brutally rarified and controlled existence at once hidden and exposed, and of a complex relationship between two isolated women who, despite being visible to all, are truly understood only by each other.

London spiraled into mourning -- crowds sported black armbands in grief -- and railed against Conan Doyle as his assassin.Then in 1901, just as abruptly as Conan Doyle had ""murdered"" Holmes in ""The Final Problem,"" he resurrected him.

Therese Raquin,Émile Zola,"Zola’s 20 Rougon-Macquart novels are a panoramic account of the Second French Empire. They are the story of a family principally between the years 1851 and 1871. These 20 novels contain over 300 major characters, who descend from the two family lines of the Rougons and Macquarts and who are related. In Zola’s words, which are the subtitle of the Rougon-Macquart series, they are ""L’Histoire naturelle et sociale d’une famille sous le Second Empire""(""The natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire""). Most of the Rougon-Macquart novels were written during the French Third Republic. To an extent, attitudes and value judgments may have been superimposed on that picture with the wisdom of hindsight. The débâcle in which the reign of Napoleon III of France culminated may have imparted a note of decadence to certain of the novels about France in the years before that disastrous defeat. Nowhere is the doom laden image of the Second Empire so clearly seen as in Nana, which culminates in echoes of the Franco-Prussian War (and hence by implication of the French defeat). Even in novels dealing with earlier periods of Napoleon III’s reign the picture of the Second Empire is sometimes overlaid with the imagery of catastrophe. In the Rougon-Macquart novels, provincial life tends to be overshadowed by Zola’s preoccupation with the capital. Only in his picture of rural working-class life in La Terre and in the corresponding picture of industrial working-class life in Germinal, does Zola convincingly escape from Paris into the provinces. The life of provincial towns is an even more noticeable omission from his achievement, for only in Le Rêve and in the twice repeated picture of Plassans (modeled upon his childhood home, Aix-en-Provence) does he achieve such a portrait (La Fortune des Rougon, La Conquête de Plassans). Le Docteur Pascal has the same setting but cannot properly be termed a novel of provincial life. La Débâcle, the military novel is set for the most part in country districts of eastern France; its dénouement takes place in the capital during the civil war leading to the suppression of the Paris Commune. Like Balzac, Zola’s imagination was roused by Paris and all that the capital represented to him.","['Fiction', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Classics', '19th Century', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Crime', 'School', 'Audiobook']",3.73,"31,474 ratings","2,580 reviews","7,785","11,756","8,394","2,625",914

The Monk,Matthew Gregory Lewis,"One of the most extravagantly dark works of Gothic fiction ever written in English, admired by the likes of Lord Byron and the Marquis de Sade, The Monk drew a firestorm of criticism when it was published in 1796. Contemporaries condemned it as ""lewd,"" ""libidinous and impious."" ""Lust, murder, incest, and every atrocity that can disgrace human nature,"" one critic cried, ""brought together, without the apology of probability, or even possibility."" Of course, it was an immediate best seller.Written by Matthew Lewis at the tender age of nineteen, The Monk tells of the violent downfall of the monk Ambrosio. Idolized by all Madrid for his spotless character, the proud Ambrosio is privately tormented with lust for Matilda and, once sated, with overpowering desire for the pure and innocent Antonia, whom he rapes and murders in the crypt of Saint Clare. Sentenced to death by the Inquisition, he sells his soul to the devil, with unusually bad results. But the plot is only part of the book's appeal. The Monk is a bubbling cauldron of Horror characters and motifs. Ghosts, murderous banditti, the Wandering Jew, a gypsy fortune teller, the Bleeding Nun, the Grand Inquisitor, and Satan himself all have roles in the drama. Characters are buried alive, tortured, tempted by demons, and torn apart by riotous mobs, in settings that include castles, monasteries, and dungeons.Stephen King, in his introduction to this edition, calls The Monk ""a black engine of sex and the supernatural that changed the genre--and the novel itself--forever."" Everyone who loves the novels of King will find this book irresistible.","['Classics', 'Gothic', 'Horror', 'Fiction', '18th Century', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'British Literature']",3.83,"27,976 ratings","2,575 reviews","8,382","10,035","6,684","2,078",797

The Other Side of the Mountain: The Story of Jill Kinmont,E.G. Valens,"This memorable book is the definitve profile of courage. It tells the story of Jill Kinmont, a talented downhill skier whose Olympic success was imminent until a terrible fall in Utah rendered her a quadriplegic. But the true success of this book lies not with the representation of Jill Kinmont as a tragic heroine, but with the portrayal of her as someone whose commitment, dedication, drive, and determination have enabled her to succeed at life, despite the tremendous obstacles she has faced. Her skiing ability is legendary, but it is as a person she stands tall. Her story proves beyond all doubt than when our bodies are at their weakest our spirits are at their strongest.This is an amazing and memorable piece of work and will be cherished by those who believe in the immortality and infallibility of the human spirit.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Sports', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Disability', 'Inspirational', 'Medical', 'True Story']",3.90,"1,274 ratings",52 reviews,358,518,330,54,14
A Very Private Life,Michael Frayn,"Frayn's unpredictable except as regards quality. Readers of his hypnotic book will be in no doubt from the 6th word on that they're in the hands of a master-sorcerer: ""Once upon a time there will be a little girl called Uncumber."" His heroine lives in a distant future when humans are divided. ""Some people are on the inside, some are on the outside. That's just the way the world is, Cumby,"" explains her father, Aelfric. Of course the insiders who are privileged, their needs catered to by somatic drugs, 3D holovision, piped sustenance--everything, even increasingly prolonged lifespans. Outsiders grub along as best they can, except when needed to help sustain inhabitants of the windowless houses. This isn't enough for Uncumber. She's haunted by a restlessly inquisitive spirit, driven by Angst that refuses to be satisfied by such devices as a love introduced & supplied by holovision. Dialing a wrong number, she espies a crude fellow speaking an unknown tongue. Smitten by love, she sets out to find him. Here's the classic Quest, replete with peril, suffering & elusive rapture. Even tho millennia removed, we're involved. We pay homage to her courage in grappling with the Outside. Relentlessly entertaining as Frayn may be--this book is shot thru with mordant hilarity--it's the real measure of worth that in the end we know a bit more about human spirit & folly than before.",[],3.48,227 ratings,28 reviews,32,82,78,32,3

Of course, anyone who’s met their grandmother Hazel would know that they came by it honestly…Join the Stone twins as they connive, cajole, and bamboozle their way across the Solar System in the company of the most high-spirited and hilarious family in all of science fiction. This light-hearted tale has some of Heinlein’s sassiest dialogue (not to mention the famous Flat Cats incident!). Oddly enough, it’s also a true example of real family values–for when you’re a Stone, your family is your highest priority.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Classics', 'Space Opera', 'Speculative Fiction']",3.88,"7,308 ratings",352 reviews,"2,123","2,658","2,097",378,52

The Unlikely Disciple: A Sinner's Semester at America's Holiest University,Kevin Roose,"As a sophomore at Brown University, Kevin Roose didn't have much contact with the Religious Right. Raised in a secular home by staunchly liberal parents, he fit right in with Brown's sweatshop-protesting, fair-trade coffee-drinking, God-ambivalent student body. So when he had a chance encounter with a group of students from Liberty University, a conservative Baptist university in Lynchburg, Virginia, he found himself staring across a massive culture gap. But rather than brush the Liberty students off, Roose decided to do something much bolder: he became one of them.Liberty University is the late Rev. Jerry Falwell's proudest accomplishment - a 10,000-student conservative Christian training ground. At Liberty, students (who call themselves ""Champions for Christ"") take classes like Introduction to Youth Ministry and Evangelism 101. They hear from guest speakers like Mike Huckabee and Karl Rove, they pray before every class, and they follow a 46-page code of conduct called ""The Liberty Way"" that prohibits drinking, smoking, R-rated movies, contact with the opposite sex, and witchcraft. Armed with an open mind and a reporter's notebook, Roose dives into life at Bible Boot Camp with the goal of connecting with his evangelical peers by experiencing their world first-hand.Roose's semester at Liberty takes him to church, class, and choir practice at Rev. Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist Church. He visits a support group for recovering masturbation addicts, goes to an evangelical hip-hop concert, and participates in a spring break mission trip to Daytona Beach, where he learns how to convert bar-hopping co-eds to Christianity. Roose struggles with his own faith throughout, and in a twist that could only have been engineered by a higher power, he conducts what would turn out to be the last in-depth interview of Rev. Falwell's life. Hilarious and heartwarming, respectful and thought-provoking, Roose's embedded report from the front lines of the culture war will inspire and entertain believers and non-believers alike.","['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Spirituality', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Sociology']",3.98,"12,047 ratings","1,500 reviews","3,587","5,399","2,433",439,189

The Hiding Place,Trezza Azzopardi,"A finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize, The Hiding Place -- Welsh novelist Trezza Azzopardi's lyrical tale of an immigrant family in Cardiff -- has been compared to Frank McCourt's bleak, stirring memoir Angela's Ashes.

With one hand permanently disfigured by a fire when she was only one month old -- the hand is beautifully described by the author as ""a closed white tulip standing in the rain; a cutoff creamy marble in the shape of a Saint; a church candle with its tears flowing down the bulb of wrist"" -- Dolores has always been treated as an outcast. Her father, Frankie Gauci, is an incorrigible gambler who bets ""more than he can afford to lose."" On the day Dolores is born, he loses his half-share of a caf&eacute, as well as the apartment above it where his family lives. Everything in Frankie's life is potential currency, including his family; he even sells his second-oldest daughter Marina to gangster Joe Medora in exchange for a house and money to pay off his debts. Dolores's mother, Mary, is driven to the edge of insanity as she watches the world around her collapse, helpless to save even her children from her husband's vices.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Literature', 'Family', 'Abuse', 'British Literature', 'Adult Fiction']",3.54,"1,695 ratings",177 reviews,318,587,538,194,58

Demon-born, he is viewed with deepest suspicion by his fellow gods who will never accept him as one of their own and for this he vows to take his revenge.From his recruitment by Odin from the realm of Chaos, through his years as the go-to man of Asgard, to his fall from grace in the build-up to Ragnarok, this is the unofficial history of the world’s ultimate trickster.","['Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Retellings', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",3.74,"14,115 ratings","2,077 reviews","3,386","5,406","3,870","1,126",327

Yet Nazneen walks a tightrope stretched between her daughters' embarrassment and her husband's resentments. Chanu calls his elder daughter the little memsahib.

A Death in the Family,James Agee,"Forty years after its original publication, James Agee's last novel seems, more than ever, an American classic. For in his lyrical, sorrowful account of a man's death and its impact on his family, Agee painstakingly created a small world of domestic happiness and then showed how quickly and casually it could be destroyed.On a sultry summer night in 1915, Jay Follet leaves his house in Knoxville, Tennessee, to tend to his father, whom he believes is dying. The summons turns out to be a false alarm, but on his way back to his family, Jay has a car accident and is killed instantly. Dancing back and forth in time and braiding the viewpoints of Jay's wife, brother, and young son, Rufus, Agee creates an overwhelmingly powerful novel of innocence, tenderness, and loss that should be read aloud for the sheer music of its prose.""An utterly individual and original book...one of the most deeply worked out expressions of human feeling that I have ever read.""--Alfred Kazin, New York Times Book Review""It is, in the full sense, poetry....The language of the book, at once luminous and discreet...remains in the mind.""--New Republic""People I know who read forty years ago still talk about it. So do I. It is a great book, and I'm happy to see it done anew.""--Andre Dubus, author of andAgee was a poet, a penetrating film critic for TIME and other magazines, an intricate public conscience, and a man who carried all his life the burden of his father's death in a car accident when Agee was six. (Forty years later to the day Agee would die of a heart attack.) He brought all of that, both his gifts and his psychic injuries, to this grave and lyrical story of Rufus Follet, a boy whose world is upended by his father's sudden death in an auto accident. What this book lacks in form it more than makes up for in subtly delineated feeling. Agee's forgiving embrace of the deeply imperfect people he describes, a kind of Whitmanesque tenderness, stays with you a long time.—R.L.

Anna and the King of Siam,Margaret Landon,"Anna Leonowens, a proper Englishwoman, was an unlikely candidate to change the course of Siamese (Thai) history. A young widow and mother, her services were engaged in the 1860s by King Mongkut of Siam to help him communicate with foreign governments and be the tutor to his children and favored concubines.Stepping off the steamer from London, Anna found herself in an exotic land she could have only dreamed of: lush landscape of mystic faiths and curious people, and a king's palace bustling with royal pageantry, ancient custom, and harems. One of her pupils, the young prince Chulalongkorn, was particularly influenced by Leonowens and her Western ideals. He learned about Abraham Lincoln and the tenets of democracy from her, and years later he would become Siam's most progressive king. He guided the country's transformation from a feudal state to a modern society, abolishing slavery and making many other radical reforms.Weaving meticulously researched facts with beautifully imagined scenes, Margret Landon recreates an unforgettable portrait of life in a forgotten exotic land. Written more than fifty years ago, and translated into dozens of languages, (the inspiration for the magical play and film ) continues to delight and enchant readers around the world.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'Asia', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Asian Literature', 'Romance']",3.79,"2,827 ratings",321 reviews,754,"1,032",775,225,41
Gulliver's Travels,Jonathan Swift,"A wickedly clever satire uses comic inversions to offer telling insights into the nature of man and society. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.Gulliver's Travels describes the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication. Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was born in Dublin.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason,Susan Kandel,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewIt started with a case of writer’s block. Pretty, vivacious Cece Caruso turned to a life of crime after her divorce. But she’s neither breaking and entering nor running cons. Instead, she’s writing biographies of famous crime novelists, and now it’s Erle Stanley Gardner’s turn under Cece’s magnifying glass.While the creator of Perry Mason had an exciting life, including his own share of courtroom dramatics as a lawyer, it was his Court of Last Resort that fascinated Cece. The Court of Last Resort was a place where those wrongly convicted could petition Gardner to find enough evidence to reopen their cases. Cece was researching the Court in the hope it would give her enough material to propel her through her unfinished chapters. In a last-ditch effort to procrastinate—while pretending to work—she goes to visit an elderly prison inmate whose desperate appeal she finds misfiled and unexplored among the otherwise meticulously organized files of the Erle Stanley Gardner Archives.From there, it’s a surprisingly short step to working the long-neglected case, just to get a feel for what Gardner did so often. That’s the first step down a slippery slope that soon pulls Cece into a case closed 40 years ago, when a man was sent to jail for killing his wife. And that cold case suddenly turns hot when the murdered woman’s sister is knifed to death shortly after Cece interviews her. Inspired by the thought of Perry Mason at her side in her quest for justice, ex beauty queen Cece straightens her stocking seams (she’s a vintage clothing buff) and sets out to untangle mysteries, solve two murders, and finish her manuscript on time.——“ art critic Susan Kandel is sure to delight readers with her innovative fictional exploration of a fascinating facet of the history of crime fiction.”","['Mystery', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Chick Lit', 'Humor', 'Murder Mystery', 'Gardening', 'Amateur Sleuth', 'Travel']",3.47,"1,040 ratings",142 reviews,149,357,399,101,34

Himself,Jess Kidd,"Abandoned on the steps of an orphanage as an infant, Dublin charmer Mahony assumed all his life that his mother had simply given him up. But when he receives a tip one night at the bar suggesting that foul play may have led to the disappearance of his mother, he decides to return to the rural Irish village where he was born to learn what really happened twenty-six years earlier.From the moment he sets foot in Mulderrig, Mahony’s presence turns the village upside down. His uncannily familiar face and outsider’s ways cause a stir among the locals, who receive him with a mixture of curiosity (the men), excitement (the women), and suspicion (the pious). It seems that his mother, Orla Sweeney, had left quite an impression on this little town—dearly beloved to some, a scourge and a menace to others. But who would have had reason to get rid of her for good?Determined to find answers, Mahony solicits the help of brash pot-stirrer and retired actress Mrs. Cauley, and the two concoct an ingenious plan to get the town talking, aided and abetted by a cast of eccentric characters, some from beyond the grave. What begins as a personal mission gradually becomes a quiet revolution: a young man and his town uniting against corruption of power, against those who seek to freeze their small worlds in time, to quash the sinister tides of progress and modernity come hell or high water. But what those people seem to forget is that Mahony has the dead on his side....Centering on a small town rife with secrets and propelled by a twisting-and-turning plot, is a gem of a book, a darkly comic mystery, and a beautiful tribute to the magic of language, legacy, and storytelling.","['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Magical Realism', 'Fantasy', 'Ireland', 'Historical Fiction', 'Irish Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Paranormal']",3.92,"13,016 ratings","2,084 reviews","3,869","5,363","2,847",700,237

"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",Simon Winchester,"Mysterious (mistîe · ries), a. [f. L. mystérium Mysteryi + ous. Cf. F. mystérieux.]1. Full of or fraught with mystery; wrapt in mystery; hidden from human knowledge or understanding; impossible or difficult to explain, solve, or discover; of obscure origin, nature, or purpose.It is known as one of the greatest literary achievements in the history of English letters. The creation of the Oxford English Dictionary began in 1857, took seventy years to complete, drew from tens of thousands of brilliant minds, and organized the sprawling language into 414,825 precise definitions. But hidden within the rituals of its creation is a fascinating and mysterious story — a story of two remarkable men whose strange twenty-year relationship lies at the core of this historic undertaking.Professor James Murray, an astonishingly learned former schoolmaster and bank clerk, was the distinguished editor of the OED project. Dr. William Chester Minor, an American surgeon from New Haven, Connecticut, who had served in the Civil War, was one of thousands of contributors who submitted illustrative quotations of words to be used in the dictionary. But Minor was no ordinary contributor. He was remarkably prolific, sending thousands of neat, handwritten quotations from his home in the small village of Crowthorne, fifty miles from Oxford. On numerous occasions Murray invited Minor to visit Oxford and celebrate his work, but Murray’s offer was regularly — and mysteriously — refused.Thus the two men, for two decades, maintained a close relationship only through correspondence. Finally, in 1896, after Minor had sent nearly ten thousand definitions to the dictionary but had still never traveled from his home, a puzzled Murray set out to visit him. It was then that Murray finally learned the truth about Minor–that, in addition to being a masterful wordsmith, Minor was also a murderer, clinically insane — and locked up in Broadmoor, England’s harshest asylum for criminal lunatics.is an extraordinary tale of madness and genius, and the incredible obsessions of two men at the heart of the Oxford English Dictionary and literary history. With riveting insight and detail, Simon Winchester crafts a fascinating glimpse into one man’s tortured mind and his contribution to another man’s magnificent dictionary.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Language', 'Books About Books', 'Historical', 'True Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Linguistics']",3.84,"115,904 ratings","7,072 reviews","33,772","43,961","27,668","6,909","3,594"

Finding Dorothy,Elizabeth Letts,"A richly imagined novel that tells the story behind The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , the book that inspired the iconic film, through the eyes of author L. Frank Baum's intrepid wife, Maud--from the family's hardscrabble days in South Dakota to the Hollywood film set where she first meets Judy Garland.Maud Gage Baum, widow of the author of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, met Judy Garland, the young actress playing the role of Dorothy on the set of The Wizard of Oz in 1939. At the time, Maud was seventy-eight and Judy was sixteen. In spite of their age difference, Maud immediately connected to Judy--especially when Maud heard her sing ""Over the Rainbow,"" a song whose yearning brought to mind the tough years in South Dakota when Maud and her husband struggled to make a living--until Frank Baum's book became a national sensation.

As Maud had promised to protect the original Dorothy back in Aberdeen, she now takes on the job of protecting young Judy.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Books About Books', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Family', 'Novels']",4.16,"24,446 ratings","4,040 reviews","9,463","10,559","3,593",599,232

Imperium,Robert Harris,"When Tiro, the confidential secretary (and slave) of a Roman senator, opens the door to a terrified stranger on a cold November morning, he sets in motion a chain of events that will eventually propel his master into one of the most suspenseful courtroom dramas in history. The stranger is a Sicilian, a victim of the island's corrupt Roman governor, Verres. The senator is Marcus Cicero—an ambitious young lawyer and spellbinding orator, who at the age of twenty-seven is determined to attain imperium—supreme power in the state.Of all the great figures of the Roman world, none was more fascinating or charismatic than Cicero. And Tiro—the inventor of shorthand and author of numerous books, including a celebrated biography of his master (which was lost in the Dark Ages)—was always by his side.Compellingly written in Tiro's voice, is the re-creation of his vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero's quest for glory, competing with some of the most powerful and intimidating figures of his—or any other—age: Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and the many other powerful Romans who changed history.Robert Harris, the world's master of innovative historical fiction, lures us into a violent, treacherous world of Roman politics at once exotically different from and yet startlingly similar to our own—a world of Senate intrigue and electoral corruption, special prosecutors and political adventurism—to describe how one clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable man fought to reach the top.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Italy', 'Politics', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'Ancient History']",4.12,"33,960 ratings","2,308 reviews","12,612","14,377","5,648","1,001",322

The wily sailor’s skillful negotiations with the pirate captain—who turns out to be a woman from his past—result in a favorable outcome that puts Jack in line for an official promotion.After making port in Africa, Jack is summoned by Cutler Beckett, who makes him captain of a ship called the Wicked Wench . Beckett gives Jack an assignment. He has heard a legend about a magical island named Zerzura whose labyrinthine bowels are said to contain a glorious treasure. Beckett suspects that one of his house slaves, a girl named Ayisha, is from Zerzura. He asks Jack to take her along on his voyage and seduce her into divulging the island’s whereabouts. In payment for his services, Beckett promises Jack a share of the treasure.But this task isn’t as easy as Jack initially believes. Before she agrees to reveal the location of her home, Ayisha insists that Jack take her to the New World to rescue her brother, who has been sold into slavery in the Bahamas. Their voyage is long and arduous, and as they weather a vicious storm and a surprise attack from an old pirate foe, Jack grows to respect and admire Ayisha’s bravery. He knows that Beckett intends to enslave her people after robbing them of their treasure, and Jack’s moral compass revolts at the idea. It might be possible to deliver Ayisha safely to Zerzura, obtain some of the treasure, and convince Beckett that he never found it . . . but the greedy E. I. T. C. official has eyes everywhere, and if he learns that Jack has foiled his plans, he could take away the thing that Captain Sparrow loves his ship—and his freedom.","['Pirates', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Adult', 'Novels']",4.21,"1,043 ratings",158 reviews,536,289,140,54,24

The Last Empress,Anchee Min,"The last decades of the nineteenth century were a violent period in China’s history marked by humiliating foreign incursions and domestic rebellion, ultimately ending in the demise of the Ch’ing dynasty. The only constant during this tumultuous time was the power wielded by one person, the resilient, ever-resourceful Tzu Hsi, Lady Yehonala -- or Empress Orchid, as readers came to know her in Anchee Min’s critically acclaimed novel covering the first part of her life.The Last Empress is the story of Orchid’s dramatic transition from a strong-willed, instinctive young woman to a wise and politically savvy leader who ruled China for more than four decades. Moving from the intimacy of the concubine quarters into the spotlight of the world stage, Orchid must face not only the perilous condition of her empire but also a series of devastating personal losses, as first her son and then her adopted son succumb to early death. Yearning only to step aside, and yet growing constantly into her role, only she—allied with the progressives, but loyal to the conservative Manchu clan of her dynasty—can hold the nation’s rival factions together.Anchee Min offers a powerful revisionist portrait based on extensive research of one of the most important figures in Chinese history. Viciously maligned by the western press of the time as the “Dragon Lady,” a manipulative, blood-thirsty woman who held onto power at all costs, the woman Min gives us is a compelling, very human leader who assumed power reluctantly, and who sacrificed all she had to protect those she loved and an empire that was doomed to die.","['Historical Fiction', 'China', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Asia', 'Asian Literature', 'Romance', '19th Century', 'Cultural', 'Novels']",3.84,"9,228 ratings",604 reviews,"2,573","3,507","2,382",617,149

Death by Water,Kerry Greenwood,"'Who are you?' asked the doctor. 'You are not the standard cruise passenger, I can tell you that.' 'Thank you,' said Phryne in a self-possessed manner. 'You are correct. I am a lot of things, some of which do not concern you, but mostly I am Phryne Fisher.'The nice men at P&O are worried. A succession of jewellery thefts from first class passengers is hardly the best advertisement for their cruise liners, particularly when it is likely that it is a passenger who is doing the stealing.Phryne Fisher, with her Lulu bob, green eyes, Cupid's bow lips and Chanel travelling suits, is exactly the sort of elegant sleuth to take on a ring of jewellery thieves aboard the high seas - or at least, aboard the SS Hinemoa on a luxury cruise to New Zealand. With the Maharani - the Great Queen of Sapphires - as the bait, Phryne rises magnificently to the challenge.There are shipboard romances, champagne cocktails, erotic photographers, jealous husbands, mickey finns, blackmail and attempted murder, all before the thieves find out - as have countless love-smitten men before them - that where the glamorous and intelligent Phryne is involved, resistance is futile.","['Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Crime', 'Australia', 'Audiobook', 'Historical Mystery', 'Murder Mystery', 'Cozy Mystery']",4.05,"4,641 ratings",358 reviews,"1,545","1,957","1,010",107,22

Love—a treasured gift reserved for those beautiful of form and face. Scorned and ridiculed most of her adult life, Shona, Lady Atterberry believes she’s utterly undesirable and is reconciled to spinsterhood. She hides her spirited temperament beneath a veneer of gauche shyness, until a strapping, scarred stranger saves her life, and she can’t deny her immediate, powerful, and sensual attraction to him. Despite how ill-suited they are and innuendos that Captain Le Draco is a fortune-hunter, she cannot escape her growing fascination. Two damaged souls searching for love. Others are determined to keep them apart, and Shona is goaded into placing a wicked wager. One that sets her upon a ruinous path and alienates the only man who might have ever loved her. Is true love enough to put their pasts behind them, to learn to trust, and heal their wounded hearts? Warning: This book contains one devilish, seemingly irredeemable rogue, an on-the-shelf wallflower who dabbles in wicked wagers, an unexpected and most enticing swim in a lake, a villainess you’ll want to shove into said lake, and a cast of captivating secondary characters with their own tantalizing romantic tales.","['Historical Romance', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Novella', 'Regency', 'Historical Fiction', 'Regency Romance', 'Amazon', 'Fiction']",4.20,694 ratings,116 reviews,330,216,113,29,6

Saving Baby,Lawrence Lindner Jo Anne Normile,"""If we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop, and do nothing, we make ourselves sharers in the guilt."" (Anna Sewell, author of Black Beauty ) Jo Anne Normile was not supposed to keep the foal, an exuberant Thoroughbred with only a few white hairs on his reddish-brown forehead. But she fell in love with the young horse, who had literally been born into her arms. The breeder finally said she could keep the colt, whom she nicknamed ""Baby""—but only if she raced him. It was difficult to take Baby away from the safety of his pasture. But Normile had made a promise. Besides, horseracing had always come across as a glamorous blend of mint juleps and celebrity, of equine grace and speed. It was a vision she found appealing. And she fell hard for it, this ""Sport of Kings."" She experienced a thrill every time Baby sprinted around the track, edging out other horses. But the magic that enchants is a veneer. For every Seabiscuit, there are tens of thousands of racehorses whose lives end in pain and despair, with indifference and corruption that runs rampant through the world of horse racing. Normile knew none of this. Not until an accident on a poorly maintained track. That's when everything changed. That's when Normile founded the most successful horse rescue in the country, an organization that would go on to save more horses than anyone else ever had. That's when she knew she had no other choice. Saving Baby is Jo Anne Normile's story of perseverance and passion. A heartbreaking and ultimately life-affirming book, it testifies to the transcending power of hope, and the unshakeable bond of love.",[],4.27,328 ratings,70 reviews,167,102,43,13,3

It is the only reasonable explanation the court can see for her willful behavior, so she is sent away to Sanibel Asylum to be restored to a good, compliant woman. Iris knows, though, that her husband is the true criminal; she is no lunatic, only guilty of disagreeing with him on notions of justice, cruelty, and property.

Ethel & Ernest,Raymond Briggs,"Poignant, funny, and utterly original, Ethel & Ernest is Raymond Briggs’s loving depiction of his parents’ lives from their chance first encounter in the 1920s until their deaths in the 1970s.Ethel and Ernest were solid members of the English working class, part of the generation that lived through the most tumultuous years of the twentieth century. They met during the Depression — she working as a maid, he as a milkman — and we follow them as they court and marry, make a home, raise their son, and cope with the dark days of World War II. Briggs’s portrayal of how his parents succeeded, or failed, in coming to terms with the events of their rapidly shifting world — the advent of radio, television, and telephones; the development of the atomic bomb; the moon landing; the social and political turmoil of the sixties — is irresistibly engaging, full of sympathy and affection, yet clear-eyed and unsentimental.Briggs’s illustrations are small masterpieces; coupled with the wonderfully candid dialogue, they evoke the exhilaration and sorrow, excitement and bewilderment, of experiencing such enormous changes. As much a social history as a personal account, is a moving tribute to ordinary people living in an extraordinary time.","['Graphic Novels', 'Nonfiction', 'Comics', 'Biography', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical']",4.18,"3,428 ratings",477 reviews,"1,415","1,368",523,104,18

Dog on It,Spencer Quinn,"Meet Chet, the wise and lovable canine narrator of Dog on It, who works alongside Bernie, a down-on-his-luck private investigator. Chet might have flunked out of police school (""I'd been the best leaper in K-9 class, which had led to all the trouble in a way I couldn't remember exactly, although blood was involved""), but he's a detective through and through.In this, their first adventure, Chet and Bernie investigate the disappearance of Madison, a teenage girl who may or may not have been kidnapped, but who has definitely gotten mixed up with some very unsavory characters. A well-behaved, gifted student, she didn't arrive home after school and her divorced mother is frantic. Bernie is quick to take the case — something about a cash flow problem that Chet's not all that clear about — and he's relieved, if vaguely suspicious, when Madison turns up unharmed with a story that doesn't add up. But when she disappears for a second time in a week, Bernie and Chet aren't taking any chances; they launch a full-blown investigation. Without a ransom demand, they're not convinced it's a kidnapping, but they are sure of one thing: something smells funny.Their search for clues takes them into the desert to biker bars and other exotic locals, with Chet's highly trained nose leading the way. Both Chet and Bernie bring their own special skills to the hunt, one that puts each of them in peril. But even as the bad guys try to turn the tables, this duo is nothing if not resourceful, and the result is an uncommonly satisfying adventure.With his doggy ways and his endearingly hardboiled voice, Chet is full of heart and occasionally prone to mischief. He is intensely loyal to Bernie, who, though distracted by issues that Chet has difficulty understanding — like divorce, child custody, and other peculiar human concerns — is enormously likable himself, in his flawed, all-too-human way.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Humor', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Detective']",3.88,"23,117 ratings","3,872 reviews","6,266","9,602","5,839","1,121",289

The Sea Wolf,Jack London,"The Sea-Wolf belongs in the honorific tradition of American sea fiction where the voyage motif became a means of exploring the meaning of life, as in Richard Henry Dana's Two Years Before the Mast (1840), Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838), and Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851). The dominant subject is an intellectual conflict between a ship-wrecked literary figure, Humphrey Van Weyden, and the brutal captain of a seal-hunting schooner, Wolf Larsen, who rescues Van Weyden and puts him to menial work on the schooner. The central chapters focus on the gory details of seal-hunting, and the final section shows how far Van Weyden has learned seamanship as he restores The Ghost to sailing health and returns to port with the only woman passenger, another shipwrecked figure, to plight their troth.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'American', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'Philosophy']",4.05,"29,915 ratings","1,820 reviews","10,869","11,511","6,044","1,176",315
