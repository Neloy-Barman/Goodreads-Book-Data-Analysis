2005 - Thanks for the Vodka,Harpie,"If you only read one book this year, make it this oneYou won’t find another book like this anywhere elseThere are books that discuss mental illness and there are books that discuss self-harm, but only from a clinical viewpoint; as in what to do if your child is one of these ‘Emo children, making pathetic little cat scratches on their arms and flaunting what they’re doing to the rest of the world.’You may even find a few fiction books, mostly in the Young Adult genre, whereby the hero or heroine cuts themselves due to home or school issues or even peer pressure.But nobody, ever, has had the bravery – until now – to tell it like it really is. Nobody has discussed the deep shame, the reasons behind self-mutilation and how this way of confronting emotional pain, acute anger or resentment is reasoned.It’s not a joke. Neither is mental illness or depression. You wouldn’t say ‘snap out of it’ to somebody with cancer, diabetes or heart disease, so what makes people feel its okay to say the same to those with depression?Previous comments on Harpie’s writing are that she “reveals her innermost thoughts, slashing a metaphoric vein and bleeding onto the page.” And those words were chosen for a reason. Harpie writes with her heart on her sleeve. She is emotionally transparent. Her feelings are as clear as the scars on her arms and legs. But the message here is that there are some scars that are never seen.This book’s not all messed up. It’s a year in the life of a working class hero who’s come to be loved by many of her fans. In ‘2005 – Thanks for the Vodka’ Harpie describes her sexual liaisons, bullying, court dates, her career as a zoo keeper, the NHS and those beautiful people who some regard as mentally unstable. And she does all this with that charming, self-deprecating sense of humour synonymous of her style of writing.As always when Harpie writes, this is a book of raw emotion …. And it bleeds",[],3.88,269 ratings,1 review,102,81,49,25,12

Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole,Susan Cain,"In her new masterpiece, the author of the bestselling phenomenon Quiet reveals the power of a bittersweet outlook on life, and why we’ve been so blind to its value.With Quiet, Susan Cain urged our society to cultivate space for the undervalued, indispensable introverts among us, thereby revealing an untapped power hidden in plain sight. Now she employs the same mix of research, storytelling, and memoir to explore why we experience sorrow and longing, and the surprising lessons these states of mind teach us about creativity, compassion, leadership, spirituality, mortality, and love.Bittersweetness is a tendency to states of longing, poignancy, and sorrow; an acute awareness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy when beholding beauty. It recognizes that light and dark, birth and death—bitter and sweet—are forever paired. A song in a minor key, an elegiac poem, or even a touching television commercial all can bring us to this sublime, even holy, state of mind—and, ultimately, to greater kinship with our fellow humans.But bittersweetness is not, as we tend to think, just a momentary feeling or event. It’s also a way of being, a storied heritage. Our artistic and spiritual traditions—amplified by recent scientific and management research—teach us its power.Cain shows how a bittersweet state of mind is the quiet force that helps us transcend our personal and collective pain. If we don’t acknowledge our own sorrows and longings, she says, we can end up inflicting them on others via abuse, domination, or neglect. But if we realize that all humans know—or will know—loss and suffering, we can turn toward each other. And we can learn to transform our own pain into creativity, transcendence, and connection.At a time of profound discord and personal anxiety, brings us together in deep and unexpected ways.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Health', 'Spirituality']",3.99,"19,194 ratings","2,419 reviews","6,384","7,556","4,119",889,246

"Sister Queens: The Noble, Tragic Lives of Katherine of Aragon and Juana, Queen of Castile",Julia Fox,"The history books have cast Katherine of Aragon, the first queen of King Henry VIII of England, as the ultimate symbol of the Betrayed Woman, cruelly tossed aside in favor of her husband’s seductive mistress, Anne Boleyn. Katherine’s sister, Juana of Castile, wife of Philip of Burgundy and mother of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, is portrayed as “Juana the Mad,” whose erratic behavior included keeping her beloved late husband’s coffin beside her for years.But historian Julia Fox, whose previous work painted an unprecedented portrait of Jane Boleyn, Anne’s sister, offers deeper insight in this first dual biography of Katherine and Juana, the daughters of Spain’s Ferdinand and Isabella, whose family ties remained strong despite their separation. Looking through the lens of their Spanish origins, Fox reveals these queens as flesh-and-blood women—equipped with character, intelligence, and conviction—who are worthy historical figures in their own right.When they were young, Juana’s and Katherine’s futures appeared promising. They had secured politically advantageous marriages, but their dreams of love and power quickly dissolved, and the unions for which they’d spent their whole lives preparing were fraught with duplicity and betrayal. Juana, the elder sister, unexpectedly became Spain’s sovereign, but her authority was continually usurped, first by her husband and later by her son. Katherine, a young widow after the death of Prince Arthur of Wales, soon remarried his doting brother Henry and later became a key figure in a drama that altered England’s religious landscape.Ousted from the positions of power and influence they had been groomed for and separated from their children, Katherine and Juana each turned to their rich and abiding faith and deep personal belief in their family’s dynastic legacy to cope with their enduring hardships.is a gripping tale of love, duty, and sacrifice—a remarkable reflection on the conflict between ambition and loyalty during an age when the greatest sin, it seems, was to have been born a woman.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Spain', 'Historical', 'Tudor Period', 'British Literature', 'Medieval', '16th Century', 'European History']",3.80,"3,298 ratings",424 reviews,776,"1,363",925,179,55

Find Peace.,Jonathan Harrison,"This highly practical guide shows you clearly and directly how to remove stress, anger, fear and worry by becoming more realistic, using 2,500 year old meditation and therapy tools and inspired by masters of nondual and Buddhist wisdom traditions including Dzogchen, Mahamudra, Zen, Madhyamika, Advaita and Tao. Jonathan Harrison teaches nondual and Buddhist meditation and psychology.The guide explains how mental stress is created and how to remove it from your life in all its forms including anger, anxiety, disappointment, discontent, dissatisfaction, dread, envy, fear, frustration, guilt, humiliation, impatience, insult, misery, mistrust, regret, tension and worry.Some of the topics covered in the guide:- Stress and its elimination- Practical issues- Discovering what is real and what is not- Eliminating worry about non-problems- Overcoming anxiety, hope and fear- Removing frustration and anger- Finding comfort by eliminating fixations- Minimizing the effect of physical and mental pain- Letting your expectations adapt themselves to reality- Improving your choices and decisions while avoiding guilt- Respecting your thoughts without believing them- Cultivating beneficial relationships- Generating immunity to praise and criticism- Achieving total freedomIn the first chapter, ""Stress and its elimination"", Jonathan Harrison shows how, in order to see how stress is created, you need to understand three things:- The way you think about things- The way things really are- The results of confusing theseThe way you think about things:You see the world as structured, split into separate parts which may be in conflict. Your particular mental structures consisting of your personal opinions and concepts is the result of many factors including your genetic makeup, parental upbringing, social and cultural environments and the way you have perceived, internalized and acted on your experiences. These mental structures develop and change throughout your life. The world as you see it is largely a reflection of your mental history. What you think is an original creation of your mind.The way things really are:Reality, the world as it is, is neither inherently split (dualistic), nor unified, neither structured nor unstructured. It just is.This is so simple that most people do not understand it.Ending stressIt is enough to grasp deeply how things really work. The past has gone, is unalterable, the future is non-existent except as your present expectations, and “now” is already here. Within this realization, true rest occurs naturally. This is non-meditation, natural meditation or “resting in natural awareness” as Longchen Rabjam, the renowned Tibetan yogi and Dzogchen meditation master, put it.By recognizing the nature of reality you are able to live, love and benefit yourself and others more easily, as you no longer experience the frustration of trying to grasp at imagined parts of your experience or trying to remove them.In his foreword to the guide, Dr. Peter Fenner states, ""The guide offers a lucid introduction to the ultimate state and outlines clear practices to realization. Jonathan’s analysis of the dualistic mind that produces all our suffering is compelling and I delight in the way he continually points us back to the inherent inner wisdom that is at the core of every conscious being.""In the foreword to the second edition, Dr. Stephen Fulder states, ""Learning meditation is not easy and it is not difficult. It is helpful if there is some good teaching to set us on the right path. This is where this book comes in. Jonathan Harrison has written a wonderful manual which is remarkable in its directness, simplicity, and sharpness. It offers very concise instructions not only on meditation but also on different ways of viewing ourselves and the world.",[],4.55,29 ratings,6 reviews,21,5,2,0,1

"Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.",Ron Chernow,"John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--history's first billionaire and the patriarch of America's most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow, the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families, gives us a history of the mogul ""etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed, balanced, and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have"" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller's exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations, the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist.        Born the son of a flamboyant, bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious, straitlaced mother, Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world's richest man by creating America's most powerful and feared monopoly, Standard Oil. Branded ""the Octopus"" by legions of muckrakers, the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America.        Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation's history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay.        While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller's misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating, complex man, synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals, tragedies, and misfortunes that have never before come to light.        John D. Rockefeller's story captures a pivotal moment in American history, documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Jay Gould, William Vanderbilt, Ida Tarbell, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Jung, J. Pierpont Morgan, William James, Henry Clay Frick, Mark Twain, and Will Rogers, Titan turns Rockefeller's life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is Ron Chernow's signal triumph that he narrates this monumental saga with all the sweep, drama, and insight that this giant subject deserves.","['Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'American History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Historical']",4.16,"30,654 ratings","1,656 reviews","14,033","10,449","4,153","1,164",855
Building Social Business: The New Kind of Capitalism That Serves Humanity's Most Pressing Needs,Muhammad Yunus,"Muhammad Yunus, the practical visionary who pioneered microcredit and, with his Grameen Bank, won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, has developed a visionary new dimension for capitalism which he calls “social business.” By harnessing the energy of profit-making to the objective of fulfilling human needs, social business creates self-supporting, viable commercial enterprises that generate economic growth even as they produce goods and services that make the world a better place.In this book, Yunus shows how social business has gone from being a theory to an inspiring practice, adopted by leading corporations, entrepreneurs, and social activists across Asia, South America, Europe and the US. He demonstrates how social business transforms lives; offers practical guidance for those who want to create social businesses of their own; explains how public and corporate policies must adapt to make room for the social business model; and shows why social business holds the potential to redeem the failed promise of free-market enterprise.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'International Development', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Sociology', 'Poverty', 'Leadership', 'Politics', 'Society']",3.97,"1,804 ratings",145 reviews,573,721,408,85,17

And he was thirty-two years old in 1900 when he gave it all up to pursue his Great Idea: to capture on film the continent’s original inhabitants before the old ways disappeared.An Indiana Jones with a camera, Curtis spent the next three decades traveling from the Havasupai at the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the Acoma on a high mesa in New Mexico to the Salish in the rugged Northwest rain forest, documenting the stories and rituals of more than eighty tribes. It took tremendous perseverance - ten years alone to persuade the Hopi to allow him into their Snake Dance ceremony. And the undertaking changed him profoundly, from detached observer to outraged advocate. Eventually Curtis took more than 40,000 photographs, preserved 10,000 audio recordings, and is credited with making the first narrative documentary film. In the process, the charming rogue with the grade school education created the most definitive archive of the American Indian.His most powerful backer was Theodore Roosevelt, and his patron was J. P. Morgan. Despite the friends in high places, he was always broke and often disparaged as an upstart in pursuit of an impossible dream. He completed his masterwork in 1930, when he published the last of the twenty volumes. A nation in the grips of the Depression ignored it. But today rare Curtis photogravures bring high prices at auction, and he is hailed as a visionary. In the end he fulfilled his promise: He made the Indians live forever.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Photography', 'Art', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Native Americans', 'Biography Memoir']",4.08,"9,303 ratings","1,172 reviews","3,808","3,450","1,323",440,

She does so as he drives down to Cape Cod, where he and his wife, Joy, will celebrate the marriage of their daughter Laura’s best friend. For Griffin this is akin to driving into the past, since he took his childhood summer vacations here, his parents’ respite from the hated Midwest. And the Cape is where he and Joy honeymooned, in the course of which they drafted the Great Truro Accord, a plan for their lives together that’s now thirty years old and has largely come true. He’d left screenwriting and Los Angeles behind for the sort of New England college his snobby academic parents had always aspired to in vain; they’d moved into an old house full of character; and they’d started a family. Check, check and check.But be careful what you pray for, especially if you manage to achieve it. By the end of this perfectly lovely weekend, the past has so thoroughly swamped the present that the future suddenly hangs in the balance. And when, a year later, a far more important wedding takes place, their beloved Laura’s, on the coast of Maine, Griffin’s chauffeuring two urns of ashes as he contends once more with Joy and her large, unruly family, and both he and she have brought dates along.
